Romanzi epici di viaggi su strada come Travels with Charley di John Steinbeck, On the Road di Jack Kerouac e Blue Highways di William Least Heat-Moon ci lasciano sempre desiderosi di quelle piccole strade e terre pubbliche dimenticate che collegano e intrecciare le nostre narrazioni di viaggio insieme. La nostra ispirazione per il campeggio fuori dalla rete nasce dal desiderio di avventurarci nell'ignoto.\", racconta Geneva Long, CEO di Bowlus Road Chief, l'azienda a conduzione familiare di designer, ambientalisti e perfezionisti che ha riportato in auge l'iconico Bowlus, il camper di alluminio ideato quasi 90 anni fa dal designer, ingegnere e costruttore di aerei Hawley Bowlus e che ha ispirato anche il famoso Airstream. Bowlus oggi rappresenta il rimorchio da viaggio più sostenibile e tecnologico al mondo. Sin dal suo inizio negli anni '30, il Bowlus ha rappresentato il meglio disponibile sul mercato per i viaggi via terra. \"Il Bowlus è un'opera d'arte moderna, pronta per essere goduta per generazioni, ma soprattutto pronta a suscitare lo spirito di avventura per generazioni.\", spiega l'azienda di Geneva Long che in poso tempo ha ottenuto già diversi riconoscimenti come \"prima azienda di camper al mondo fondata da donne\" e \"primo camper veramente sostenibile\". Bowlus produce uno dei camper più lussuosi che esista sul mercato, il primo con pavimenti riscaldati, wifi a bordo e alimentato al litio. L'innovativo ed elegante4 rimorchio è il meglio che si possa desiderare per vacanze on the road. Bowlus è caratterizzato da un guscio in alluminio aeronautico con oltre 5.000 rivetti posizionati in modo impeccabile. Gli interni sono in vera betulla, acciaio inossidabile e alluminio. Tessuti e biancheria di lusso vengono scelti per esaltare il carattere esclusivo del Bowlus e i dettagli sono cuciti a mano da abili sarte.\n",

      "I cosiddetti “Big Data” rappresentano una risorsa preziosissima da analizzare ed estrapolare, sia per condurre indagini statistiche che in ottica predittiva. Basti pensare all'algoritmo messo a punto nei mesi scorsi da scienziati americani dell'Università Johns Hopkins, in grado di prevedere i focolai di COVID-19 con 2-3 settimane di anticipo, analizzando i contenuti dei “cinguettii” degli utenti di Twitter e le notizie su Google. Una mole enorme di dati (i Big Data, appunto) da dare in pasto a un'intelligenza artificiale avanzata. Il Pentagono, ovvero il Dipartimento della Difesa degli Stati Uniti, ha appena annunciato che sta testando un sofisticatissima IA che ha l'obiettivo di prevedere con “giorni di anticipo” eventi di grande rilevanza nazionale e internazionale, analizzando dati da molteplici fonti. Sebbene siamo ancora lontani dalla fantascienza alla base del blockbuster hollywoodiano Minority Report, nel quale venivano previsti con precisione chirurgica anche gli omicidi, il nuovo sistema potrebbe fornire un enorme vantaggio strategico sia alle forze armate statunitensi che alle operazioni civili. A descrivere il nuovo programma, chiamato Global Information Dominance Experiments (GIDE), è stato il generale dell'aeronautica statunitense e Glen D. VanHerck, durante una conferenza stampa ad hoc. “Il GIDE incarna un cambiamento fondamentale nel modo in cui utilizziamo le informazioni e i dati per migliorare lo spazio decisionale per i leader, dal livello tattico al livello strategico. Non solo per i leader militari, ma offre anche opportunità per i nostri leader civili”, ha dichiarato VanHerck, comandante del NORTHCOM e del NORAD. Ovviamente il generale non si è sbilanciato sui dettagli e sul funzionamento effettivo della rete di intelligenze artificiali del GIDE, ma non è difficile interpretarne almeno i meccanismi di base. I dati proverranno da un'enorme varietà di fonti, che spaziano dalle immagini satellitari alle rilevazioni radar, passando per i rapporti di intelligence, segnali radio, sensori di vario genere, telecamere e moltissimo altro ancora. Per fare un esempio pratico, tra le informazioni coinvolte potrebbe esservi l'aumento delle attività attorno a centri di ricerca e basi militari. Un parcheggio che si riempie, un insolito transito di uomini, mezzi e merci potrebbero infatti suggerire la preparazione di qualcosa. I satelliti sono in grado di rilevare tali movimenti e, combinandoli con altri dati, la rete del GIDE – che sfrutta il machine learnig o apprendimento automatico – potrebbe prevedere dove e quando si verificherà questo evento. La rete di IA, del resto, elabora i dati con molta più rapidità di un uomo e può \"collegare i puntini\" con largo anticipo, se sapientemente istruita.\n",

      "Continuano ad aumentare i nuovi casi di coronavirus nel nostro Paese. Sono stati 2.800 i contagi registrati ieri: numeri che preoccupano il governo e che ricordano quelli delle fasi più critiche dell'emergenza. Domani l'esecutivo si riunirà e valuterà se sia il caso di rendere più severe le norme anti-contagio attualmente in vigore. Entro la prossima settimana si attende il nuovo Dpcm contenente le misure di contrasto all'epidemia, mentre si valuta la proroga dello stato di emergenza fino al prossimo 31 gennaio 2021. Ma vediamo quindi quali sono queste nuove regole che il governo sta pensando di introdurre per frenare la curva dei contagi. L'obbligo di portare la mascherina all'aperto, già introdotto nei giorni scorsi in alcune zone, sarà esteso a tutto il territorio nazionale. Oltre quindi a confermare la necessità di indossare sempre il dispositivo di protezione nei luoghi chiusi, di igienizzare frequentemente le mani e di rispettare le distanze di sicurezza e il divieto di assembramento, il governo studia se rendere alcune misure più stringenti. In particolare, saranno potenziati i controlli nei luoghi della movida o dove è più facile che si vadano a costituire affollamenti. Le operazioni di vigilanza saranno affidate anche ai militari impegnati nel progetto \"Strade sicure\". Il ministro della Salute, Roberto Speranza, si sarebbe detto favorevole all'estensione dell'obbligo di mascherina all'aperto a tutto il Paese, mantenendosi per quella linea di prudenza sostenuta fin dallo scoppio dell'emergenza. La stessa considerazione, d'altronde, è condivisa anche dalla autorità locali, dal momento che diversi governatori hanno già emesso delle ordinanze che impongono di coprire naso e bocca all'aperto, con multe salate per chi non rispetta le nuove regole. Il governo continua ad escludere la possibilità di tornare a una situazione di lockdown generale. Ma se i contagi continuassero a crescere a questi ritmi, potrebbero essere imposte alcune limitazioni in specifiche zone. In questo senso si sta anche considerando di introdurre un chiusura per bar e locali alle 22 o alle 23: una chiusura anticipata affinché non si ripetano situazioni di movida, come abbiamo visto anche quest'estate, in cui si favorisce la diffusione dell'infezione. All'aperto non sarà inoltre consentito riunire più di mille persone alla volta (ovviamente sempre secondo le regole del distanziamento): questa regola sarà valida sia per le manifestazioni che per gli eventi sportivi. Anche il limite per gli stadi resta a mille spettatori. Negli spazi chiusi, invece, il tetto rimane a 200 persone: questo vale sia per cinema, teatri e sale da concerto, ma anche per le celebrazioni private come i matrimoni. Le discoteche resteranno sicuramente chiuse, nei ristoranti si dovrà continuare a rispettare il distanziamento e anche nei negozi gli ingressi saranno contingentati.\n",

Il suo parto è stato un’esperienza traumatica: ha perso tre litri di sangue ed ha subito gravi danni interni, tanto che i medici le avevano proibito di praticare il suo sport preferito, il body building. Jenna, però, non si è arresa e, dopo quattro mesi di fisioterapia, ha voluto ricominciare a fare sport. Ha lentamente riacquistato la forza muscolare ed oggi è di nuovo in grado di sollevare i pesi senza problemi.\n",

      "La risposta definitiva a chi pensa che il cast, gli attori, non fanno il cinema. Per rilanciare la serie di Indiana Jones nell’89, George Lucas e Menno Meyjes (regista di Manolete con Penelope Cruz) tirano fuori l'idea del padre sparito e ritrovato che farebbe molto soap-opera se non fosse per l'attore chiamato a coprire il ruolo di Henry Jones: Sean Connery, la più grande icona avventurosa di sempre. James Bond accanto a Indiana Jones. Ne esce fuori il più divertente episodio della serie, in cui l'intreccio tra avventura, storia, mistero e commedia raggiunge vette di perfezione. Indy, parte ovviamente alla ricerca del padre, ma non sa che c'è qualcos' altro di molto più grandioso da cercare: il Sacro Graal, sulle cui tracce si sono messi anche i nazisti. E il rapporto tra Harrison Ford (coinvolto nel progetto del quinto film della serie sul Triangolo delle Bermude) e Connery dà il pepe, il ritmo, il sorriso a un film spericolato tanto nell'azione quanto nelle libertà storiche. Forse, il film più amato della serie, il più ricordato e celebrato proprio per l'eterogeneità degli elementi, di sicuro uno dei più visti, col suo incasso di quasi 500 milioni di dollari. Una pietra miliare, almeno per chi ama sognare e vivere il cinema.\n",

      "Non lo vuole sposare. E’ quanto emerge all’interno dell’ultima intervista di Raffaella Fico che, ringraziando Mancini per i buoni consigli elargiti al suo fidanzato, rimanda l’idea del matrimonio per qualche anno ancora. La soubrette, che è stata recentemente protagonista di una dedica di Supermario, non ha ancora intenzione di accasarsi perché è sicura che per mettersi la fede al dito ci sia ancora tempo. Nonostante il suo Mario sia uno degli sportivi più desiderati al mondo, l’ex protagonista del Grande Fratello non ha alcuna intenzione di cedere seriamente alla sua corte. Solo qualche giorno fa, infatti, dopo l’ultima bravata di Balotelli, Mancini gli aveva consigliato di sposare la sua Raffaella e di mettere la testa a posto. Chi pensava che sarebbe stato Mario a rispondere, però, si è sbagliato. A mettere le cose bene in chiaro è la Fico che, intervistata dall’emittente radiofonica Rtl 102.5, dice: È presto per sposarsi, siamo ancora molto giovani. È giusto che prima uno si realizzi nel proprio lavoro. E poi successivamente perché no, ci si può anche pensare. Quando si è giovani capita di fare qualche pazzia, quindi ci sta. Comunque i tabloid inglesi sono totalmente accaniti sulla sua vita privata quando poi dovrebbero interessarsi di più di quello che fa sul campo. Lui non fa le cose con cattiveria, ma quando si è giovani si fanno determinate cose senza stare a pensare se sono giuste o sbagliate. Mario ha gli obiettivi puntati addosso: più per la sua vita privata che come giocatore. Per me può anche andare in uno strip club, se non fa niente di male, con gli amici, però devo dire che alla fine torna sempre da me, sono la sua preferita.\n",

      "\"Tran tran\" era nato per essere solo un singolo, pare, finché Sfera Ebbasta, sommerso dal successo del pezzo, ha deciso di legittimarlo e dargli spazio anche nel suo nuovo \"Rockstar\", il suo terzo album ufficiale, dopo \"XDVR\" del 2015 e quello omonimo del 2016. Gionata Boschetti da Cinisello Balsamo è probabilmente uno dei personaggi più influenti del genere e in coppia con un altro enfant prodige come Charlie Charles ha optato per un album molto variegato che, però, è meno cupo del precedente e gioca sull'alternanza tra pezzi più \"catchy\" e altri più scuri, come dimostra subito l'accoppiata \"Rockstar\", singolo e forse uno dei più \"radiofonici\" del mazzo e la successiva \"Serpenti a sonagli\". Dopo il \"King del rap\" Marracash, Sfera poteva puntare a un \"Trapstar\", ma ha preferito non limitarsi al genere e optare per un più universale \"Rockstar\": \"Avevamo pensato che avrebbe potuto chiamarsi anche ‘Trapstar', ma ci sembrava troppo riduttivo, i nuovi rapper e i nuovi trapper sono le nuove rockstar, per lo stile, per come vengono visti. Abbiamo deciso di chiamarlo Rockstar, innanzitutto per dargli la giusta importanza e poi per sottolineare questa situazione\". Ma quello delle rockstar è anche parte del suo bagaglio, visto che il padre, scomparso quando il cantante era piccolo, era un fan con un'enorme collezione di vinili e decine di chitarre in casa. Universal ci ha puntato tantissimo, forse è uno dei primi trapper per cui l'investimento è così massiccio: Milano è tappezzata di manifesti giganti, per strada, sui palazzi e nelle metropolitane, senza contare la copertina di Rolling Stone che lo ha lanciato. Motivo per cui Sfera pare preso molto bene sorprendendosi quando in conferenza stampa ha visto la quantità di giornalisti presenti. Il suo percorso è ormai noto, dalla periferia di Cinisello Balsamo (Ciny per i fan) fino al successo (\"Cresciuto tra quei palazzi lì, ora sto in Centro su macchina nera\", come canta in \"Uber\"), l'impressione per alcuni – sicuramente i fan delle rockstar – che il pubblico sia solo di ragazzini, ma la convinzione, data anche da alcuni dati, che il pubblico del genere e del cantante siano anche più grandi: \"Sul fatto che la trap sia musica per ragazzini, sono uscite varie statistiche che dicono che l'ascoltatore medio ha più di 18 anni, ma se guardo alle statistiche dei social la maggior parte dei fan va dai 18 ai 24 anni, quindi non è solo per ragazzini. Vedo tante persone adulte che si complimentano, che ascoltano la mia musica e dicono che spacca, poi i ragazzini sono quelli che si fanno più vedere sui social, ma fanno parte di un grosso gruppo\". Meno periferia in \"Rockstar\" anche perché, come spiega lui stesso, il tempo passa, e le cose cambiano, ma non manca mai il riferimento al proprio passato e, come avveniva in \"Tran Tran\", il sottolineare sempre come sia l'esempio di uno che ce l'ha fatta, alla faccia di chi lo critica. \"Rockstar\" è, insomma, l'album che dovrà confermare quanto di buono, almeno a livello numerico, si è visto nel 2017, quando il genere è esploso, anche grazie ai nuovi conteggi FIMI che per lo scorso anno ha considerato anche gli streaming gratuiti (dal 2018 conteranno solo quelli a pagamento).\n",

Gionata Boschetti da Cinisello Balsamo è probabilmente uno dei personaggi più influenti del genere e in coppia con un altro enfant prodige come Charlie Charles ha optato per un album molto variegato che, però, è meno cupo del precedente e gioca sull'alternanza tra pezzi più \"catchy\" e altri più scuri, come dimostra subito l'accoppiata \"Rockstar\", singolo e forse uno dei più \"radiofonici\" del mazzo e la successiva \"Serpenti a sonagli\". Dopo il \"King del rap\" Marracash, Sfera poteva puntare a un \"Trapstar\", ma ha preferito non limitarsi al genere e optare per un più universale \"Rockstar\": \"Avevamo pensato che avrebbe potuto chiamarsi anche ‘Trapstar', ma ci sembrava troppo riduttivo, i nuovi rapper e i nuovi trapper sono le nuove rockstar, per lo stile, per come vengono visti. Abbiamo deciso di chiamarlo Rockstar, innanzitutto per dargli la giusta importanza e poi per sottolineare questa situazione\". Ma quello delle rockstar è anche parte del suo bagaglio, visto che il padre, scomparso quando il cantante era piccolo, era un fan con un'enorme collezione di vinili e decine di chitarre in casa. Universal ci ha puntato tantissimo, forse è uno dei primi trapper per cui l'investimento è così massiccio: Milano è tappezzata di manifesti giganti, per strada, sui palazzi e nelle metropolitane, senza contare la copertina di Rolling Stone che lo ha lanciato. Motivo per cui Sfera pare preso molto bene sorprendendosi quando in conferenza stampa ha visto la quantità di giornalisti presenti. Il suo percorso è ormai noto, dalla periferia di Cinisello Balsamo (Ciny per i fan) fino al successo (\"Cresciuto tra quei palazzi lì, ora sto in Centro su macchina nera\", come canta in \"Uber\"), l'impressione per alcuni – sicuramente i fan delle rockstar – che il pubblico sia solo di ragazzini, ma la convinzione, data anche da alcuni dati, che il pubblico del genere e del cantante siano anche più grandi: \"Sul fatto che la trap sia musica per ragazzini, sono uscite varie statistiche che dicono che l'ascoltatore medio ha più di 18 anni, ma se guardo alle statistiche dei social la maggior parte dei fan va dai 18 ai 24 anni, quindi non è solo per ragazzini. Vedo tante persone adulte che si complimentano, che ascoltano la mia musica e dicono che spacca, poi i ragazzini sono quelli che si fanno più vedere sui social, ma fanno parte di un grosso gruppo\". Meno periferia in \"Rockstar\" anche perché, come spiega lui stesso, il tempo passa, e le cose cambiano, ma non manca mai il riferimento al proprio passato e, come avveniva in \"Tran Tran\", il sottolineare sempre come sia l'esempio di uno che ce l'ha fatta, alla faccia di chi lo critica. \"Rockstar\" è, insomma, l'album che dovrà confermare quanto di buono, almeno a livello numerico, si è visto nel 2017, quando il genere è esploso, anche grazie ai nuovi conteggi FIMI che per lo scorso anno ha considerato anche gli streaming gratuiti (dal 2018 conteranno solo quelli a pagamento).\n",

      "Un bambino di 3 anni è deceduto dopo essere caduto dal terzo piano di un edificio in via Foria, nel centro di Napoli, nelle vicinanze della ex caserma Garibaldi, sede dell'Ufficio del Giudice di Pace. La tragedia è avvenuta nella tarda mattinata di oggi, 17 settembre, poco prima delle 13. La Procura ha aperto una inchiesta, la salma del piccolo è stata sequestrata e verrà svolta nei prossimi giorni l'autopsia; la dinamica è in fase di ricostruzione. Sul posto è intervenuta la Polizia di Stato per i rilievi e l'avvio delle indagini. Il piccolo, a quanto si apprende, è precipitato dalla sua abitazione, non è ancora accertato se da una finestra o da un balcone, in un palazzo all'angolo tra via Foria e una delle traverse, via Giuseppe Piazzi, una zona molto popolosa. Pare che al momento della caduta si trovasse da solo in casa con la madre, sarebbe sfuggito al controllo mentre la donna era in un'altra stanza e si sarebbe sporto, finendo col perdere l'equilibrio.\n",

Le motivazioni possono essere due: da un lato un improbabile flop di Apple con il nuovo telefono, considerato troppo simile al modello dello scorso anno e poco appetibile per l'utenza. È improbabile perché pur essendo una versione \"di passaggio\" simile ai modelli \"S\" degli scorsi anni, l'iPhone 8 rappresenta di fatto un passo avanti che coinvolge diversi punti dello smartphone, dal design alle funzionalità, che sotto molti aspetti risultano identiche a quelle dell'iPhone X. Dall'altra parte il \"flop\" dei preordini dell'iPhone 8 potrebbe rappresentare proprio un'avvisaglia del successo del top di gamma in uscita il prossimo 3 novembre.\n",

      "A tre giorni di distanza dall'inizio dei preordini dei nuovi iPhone 8 e 8 Plus, sul sito di Apple le cose stanno andando diversamente rispetto agli anni passati. Se con i lanci precedenti le tempistiche per le consegne si spostavano in pochi minuti ad oltre un mese dopo l'acquisto, questa volta le cose sono andate in altro modo.

      "Le voci su un nuovo arrivo in casa Ferragnez si fanno sempre più insistenti. Secondo fonti vicine a Fanpage.it, Chiara Ferragni è incinta e il suo annuncio sarebbe prossimo. Al momento non ci sono dettagli in grado di dare sostanza a un'indiscrezione di cui, tuttavia, si vocifera da giorni. L'imprenditrice e fashion blogger, sposata con Fedez dal 2018 e certamente tra i personaggi italiani più influenti al mondo in questo momento storico, ha messo al mondo nello stesso anno il suo primo figlio Leone, quotidianamente presente nei racconti familiari dei due genitori attraverso i social, che però non utilizzano solo ed esclusivamente per raccontarsi ai fan giornalmente. Da tempo, ormai, sui profili della nota influencer e in particolare attraverso Instagram, non appaiono più solo look con abiti griffati. In diverse occasioni, infatti, Ferragni ha detto la sua su tematiche di attualità di grande peso ha mandato, contribuendo alla discussione pubblica su temi come la violenza sulle donne e il razzismo. Recentemente aveva parlato, non senza suscitare polemiche, della morte violenta avvenuta a Colleferro del giovane Willy Monteiro Duarte. Alcune ore fa, invece, nelle sue stories Instagram è apparso un lungo messaggio scritto dall'influencer per portare l'attenzione su un caso di cronaca legato ad abusi e violenza contro una donna.\n",

      "Tra i film che dovevano arrivare nelle sale cinematografiche in questi mesi e hanno poi posticipato la loro data d'uscita, vi era anche Wonder Woman 1984, il sequel del noto film con protagonista Gal Gadot che sarebbe dovuto approdare sul grande schermo a partire da questa estate. La Warner Bros ha recentemente annunciato che per non rimandare ulteriormente l'arrivo del film, potremo vederlo tutti sulla piattaforma streaming di HBO, ma stando alle ultime notizie, pare che la grande casa di produzione cinematografica abbia deciso di distribuire la pellicola anche nelle sale europee e non solo in quelle americane, come inizialmente previsto. Stando a quanto dichiarato dalla Warner Bros, quindi, Wonder Woman 1984 seguirà un calendario ben preciso di uscite, a partire dal 16 dicembre, data in cui apparirà sul grande schermo di molti paesi del mondo, compresi Francia e Regno Unito. In America, come già annunciato, sia nelle sale che in streaming il film arriverà il giorno di Natale, quando sarà distribuito ovunque sia attivo il servizio streaming della piattaforma HBO Max. In Italia, però, seguendo il calendario reso noto dalla casa di produzione e tenendo conto dei prossimi sviluppi da parte del governo, dovrebbe arrivare nei cinema a partire dal 28 gennaio.\n",

      "Introdotto dal decreto Covid del 22 aprile, il green pass (chiamato anche certificazione verde), è un certificato che permette di viaggiare sul territorio nazionale anche dall'estero. Tale certificazione, disponibile dalla metà di giugno, sarà poi sostituita dall'Eu Digital Certificate Covid-19, un documento ideato dalla Commissione europea per permettere di viaggiare tra i paesi dell'Unione europea e la cui entrata in vigore è prevista per il 1° luglio. Necessario per partecipare a matrimoni (anche in zona bianca) e concerti e per entrare in discoteca, il pass nazionale sarà disponibile sulle app Io e Immuni o tramite il sito di Sogei. Può essere rilasciato già dopo la prima dose di vaccino (con validità a partire dal 15esimo giorno successivo alla somministrazione) e la durata del pass dipenderà dal tipo di vaccino somministrato. In caso di guarigione dal covid-19, il certificato verde avrà validità di 6 mesi, di 48 ore, invece, con tampone negativo. Nelle Faq del Ministero della Salute, le risposte alle domande più frequenti sul Green Pass per l'estate, a cosa serve, quanto durerà e come richiederlo. Cos'è il Green Pass Covid? Si tratta di una certificazione verde introdotta in Italia con il decreto covid dello scorso 22 aprile che attesta una delle seguenti condizioni: Permette di viaggiare sul territorio nazionale e spostarsi tra Regioni in zona rossa e arancione, anche se attualmente l'Italia è quasi tutta in fascia gialla, con tre regioni in zona bianca. Non si tratta di un passaporto vaccinale come è stato definito inizialmente, ma di un documento, in formato cartaceo o digitale A cosa serve la certificazione verde? Oltre a permettere di viaggiare e spostarsi su tutto il territorio nazionale, il certificato verde servirà per partecipare a feste, cerimonie e matrimoni dal 15 giugno in zona gialla e dal 31 maggio nelle regioni in zona bianca. Potrebbe essere richiesto anche ai partecipanti di concerti ed eventi e, quando saranno riaperte, per andare in discoteca. Inoltre, avere la certificazione vaccinale eviterà ai turisti in entrata in Italia la quarantena di 14 giorni. Il decreto legge del 18 maggio ha introdotto un'importante novità sul Green Pass. La certificazione verde potrà essere rilasciata \"anche contestualmente alla somministrazione della prima dose di vaccino\". Il Green Pass, quindi, potrà essere rilasciato già dopo la prima somministrazione ma con una validità a partire dal 15° giorno successivo all'inoculazione della prima dose vaccinale. Quanto dura il certificato verde? E fino a quando sarà valido? Per chi ha completato il ciclo vaccinale, la durata del green pass è stata estesa con il decreto legge del 18 maggio a 9 mesi. Per chi riceve la certificazione verde dopo la prima dose, la validità inizierà dal 15esimo giorno successivo alla prima somministrazione e fino alla data della seconda somministrazione. Quindi, di fatto, i vaccinati con AstraZeneca, la cui seconda dose viene somministrata a distanza di 3 mesi, avranno di fatto un pass dalla validità di 12 mesi. Con i vaccini Pzifer e Moderna, il cui richiamo avviene a distanza di 40 giorni, il green pass sarà valido per 10 mesi. Con Johnson&Johnson, vaccino in un'unica dose, il certificato sarà valido per 9 mesi. Nel caso in cui il certificato verde venga rilasciato dopo l'avvenuta guarigione dal Covid-19, la validità sarà di 6 mesi.\n",

      "Fabrizio Corona e Silvia Provvedi si raccontano al settimanale \"Mio\" e fugano ogni dubbio sulla loro relazione. Un'estate 2016 all'insegna del gossip che li stringe sempre più nella morsa e nel dubbio che la loro sia una storia effettivamente genuina. “Io e Fabrizio Corona ci vogliamo molto bene e siamo felici insieme!”. Replica così Silvia Provvedi alle tante voci di una possibile crisi nella relazione tra lei e il re dei paparazzi. Fabrizio non è certo una novità, è un personaggio ‘di rottura’ che da sempre divide gli italiani. C’è chi lo apprezza e chi lo critica, ma questo vale per tutti i personaggi pubblici. Forse lui, rispetto ad altri, è perennemente al centro dell’attenzione per via del suo passato. Anche Giulia Provvedi, sorella di di Silvia, parla della relazione con Corona e del suo rapporto con lui: Io voglio molto bene a Fabrizio e amo mia sorella. Sono felice per loro, ma soprattutto per Silvia, perché la vedo molto serena. Intanto, dopo l’esperienza sull’Isola dei Famosi, Silvia e Giulia sono state chiamate a condurre il programma Italian Pro Surfer su Italia 1. Anche Corona potrebbe presto essere protagonista di un reality, il prossimo Grande Fratello Vip su Canale 5. Lo ha confermato a “Mio” la stessa Silvia: “Sì, è in trattativa”.\n",

      "Cominciano ad uscire i primi dettagli della vita della stilista L'Wren Scott, trovata morta suicida ieri dalla sua assistente nella sua casa di Manhattan, volti a dare un senso alla sua tragica morte avvenuta con un foulard usato per impiccarsi. Ieri il Daily Mail ha svelato che l'agenzia della stilista era piena di debiti, per un totale che ammontava a più di 5 milioni di dollari; cifra che, però, continuava ad aumentare anno dopo anno e non se ne vedeva la fine. Nel 2009 i debiti ammontavano a circa 2 milioni e mezzo di euro arrivati a più di 3 l'anno successivo. Insomma lo shock iniziale e l'incredulità nei confronti di questa tragedia cominciano a lasciare spazio alle prime motivazioni. La modella non ha lasciato alcun messaggio per spiegare il proprio gesto: \"L'Wren si trovava in enormi guai finanziari – ha detto una fonte al Mail Online -. Non era più in grado di pagare il suo staff e i suoi fornitori e questo andava avanti da un po'\" e insomma nonostante le personalità di alto profilo che avevano vestito i suoi abiti, il commercio non era mai volato. Questi problemi, si dice, siano anche dietro al suo improvviso forfait alla London Fashion Week di gennaio. Una cancellazione all'ultimo minuto la cui scusa ufficiale fu quella di ritardi di fabbrica ma che sarebbe dovuta alla difficoltà economiche della sua azienda. Stando sempre alle fonti del quotidiano la Scott si sarebbe sempre rifiutata di chiedere aiuto al suo compagno per ripianare i propri debiti, anche perché la stilista aveva sempre evitato l\"etichetta di \"fidanzata di….\". Intanto sono uscite le prime foto che ritraggono Jagger subito dopo aver appreso la notizia della morte della compagna. Faccia distrutta e occhi rossi, fotografato all'uscita di un ristorante di Perth, in Australia, dove domani era previsto la prima data del tour australiano, prontamente annullata. Subito dopo le prime notizie sul decesso della Scott il cantante si era detto \"completamente scioccato e devastato\". Anche la figlia 22enne del cantante Georgia (avuta da Jerry Hall) ha voluto annullare la propria partecipazione alla Melbourne Fashion Week, a seguito del tragico evento. La modella avrebbe dovuto sfilare per la designer Camila Franks: Alla luce dei recenti tristi eventi, Georgia May Jagger non parteciperà alla Melbourne Fashion Festival per lo Showcase di Camilla. Vi chiediamo rispetto per Miss Jagger e la sua privacy in questo momento difficile\" ha comunicato un portavoce della ragazza.\n",

      "Il tè verde può combattere l'obesità e l'infiammazione legata ai disturbi metabolici, migliorando sensibilmente la salute dell'intestino. Lo ha dimostrato un team di ricerca americano guidato da scienziati dell'Università del Texas di San Antonio, che hanno collaborato con i colleghi dell'Università Statale dell'Ohio. Gli studiosi, coordinati dai professori Chwan-Li Shen e Richard Bruno, sono giunti alle loro conclusioni dopo aver condotto alcuni esperimenti con i topi, basati sui risultati di precedenti indagini. In passato, infatti, erano emerse associazioni positive tra le catechine e i polifenoli anti-infiammatori presenti nel tè verde con processi antitumorali e un rischio ridotto di malattie cardiache e del fegato; per questo gli scienziati hanno deciso di verificare più a fondo. L'esperimento. Li Shen, Bruno e colleghi, sospettando che il tè verde potesse prevenire il rischio di obesità e proteggere dall'infiammazione intestinale, hanno alimentato per otto settimane due gruppi di topi con una dieta specifica. Al primo gruppo è stata somministrata una dieta ricca di grassi per favorire l'obesità, mentre il secondo è stato trattato con una dieta standard. A metà di ciascuno dei due gruppi è stato mescolato al cibo un estratto di tè verde per verificarne gli effetti. Al termine della sperimentazione gli scienziati hanno osservato che, nel gruppo di topi alimentati con la dieta ricca di grassi, quelli trattati con tè verde avevano accumulato il 20 percento del peso in meno rispetto agli altri, inoltre avevano sviluppato una minore resistenza all'insulina. Ma non solo. Bruno e colleghi hanno infatti rilevato anche una minore infiammazione intestinale e del tessuto adiposo; una concentrazione inferiore di endotossina; intestino meno permeabile e un microbiota intestinale di qualità superiore, cioè più ricco e vario di batteri \"buoni\". Benefici analoghi sono stati osservati anche nei topi trattati con dieta regolare e tè verde, anche se in misura meno significativa rispetto al gruppo dei cibi grassi.\n",

      "Uomini e Donne, quest'anno, ha regalato tante emozioni ai telespettatori. Ma è soprattutto una coppia ad aver incantato il pubblico. A due mesi dalla scelta di Teresanna Pugliese, la tronista si dichiara ancora innamorata di Antonio Passarelli e non rimpiange la decisione di aver mollato Francesco Monte. Ovviamente il web non le ha perdonato il trattamento riservato al bel tarantino, tanto che un coro di proteste si è sollevato dalla rete dichiarando a gran voce: Teresanna Pugliese è una falsa. Ma la tronista fa spallucce alle e ribadisce il suo punto di vista: Mi dispiace per quelli che si aspettavano il contrario, ma la nostra storia ha basi solide. Non stiamo assieme per farci pubblicità o per uscire sui giornali. La nostra relazione è vera e si basa su sentimenti profondi. Eppure gatta ci cova o per meglio dire il passato ritorna sempre. E così a rovinare la festa sono proprio le relazione passate che i due piccioncini hanno intrecciato prima di conoscersi. Entrambi però si dichiarano pronti a mettere una pietra sul tempo andato: \"Insieme cancelleremo due passati da scordare\", anche perchè era stata proprio Teresanna ad annunciare agli appassionati di Uomini e Donne di essere pazza di Antonio Passarelli. Tuttavia le discussioni non mancano mai come in ogni coppia che si rispetti: \"Litighiamo per sciocchezze, ma non riusciamo stare lontani, e finora non siamo mai stati più di mezza giornata senza parlarci\". “quando ho scoperto che era stato, senza saperlo, con una escort, sono rimasta di stucco” Teresanna Pugliese Il motivo dei battibecchi è da imputare alla gelosia. I due piccioncini infatti non riescono ancora a perdonarsi il loro passato sentimentale e mentre l'ex corteggiatore punta il dito contro un tatuaggio della sua dolce metà dedicato a un suo ex: \"Ogni volta che guardo quel cuore non faccio salti di gioia, ma mi ha promesso che lo cancellerà\", Teresanna Pugliese non riesce a mettere da parte i trascorsi di Antonio: \"Oggi l’unico vero neo tra noi sono le storie vissute prima di incontrarci. Per esempio, quando ho scoperto che era stato, senza saperlo, con una escort, sono rimasta di stucco\".\n",

      "L'epidemia da Covid-19, con la quale il mondo intero sta facendo i conti da più di sei mesi, ha avuto delle ripercussioni piuttosto gravi su svariati settori dell'economia attivi nel nostro Paese. Tra i comparti decisamente più in difficoltà c'è quello che riguarda il mondo dello spettacolo, soprattutto quello dal vivo, che in seguito all'annullamento di concerti e manifestazioni, ha lasciato senza lavoro migliaia di lavoratori che, proprio lo scorso sabato, hanno messo in atto una protesa a Milano, per poter puntare ancora una volta l'attenzione su un settore profondamente in crisi. Dopo svariati appelli da parte degli artisti, arriva quella che a conti fatti, è una delle prime proposte più concrete per risollevare le sorti di un mondo che rischia il collasso. Ed è così che Fedez, usando il suo profilo Instagram, diventa portavoce di un'iniziativa. Il rapper milanese si trova a proporre, nuovamente, una soluzione già avanzata qualche mese fa e che ritiene possa essere di aiuto in un momento difficile come quello che stiamo vivendo, in modo da supportare le maestraneze che si trovano a dover combattere con la mancanza di lavoro e di stipendio: \"Utilizzo i miei spazi social per proporre una soluzione pragmatica e anche le società di booking possono mettere in atto. Ogni artista di un certo calibro, di quelli che riempiono i palazzetti, ha nel suo contratto una cosa che si chiama anticipo minimo garantito. Chi ha visto le proprie date rimandate a causa del covid ha percepito delle somme di denaro importanti. Io ho deciso di riunciare al 100% del mio anticipo minimo, se anche altri rinunciassero anche solo a una parte della somma, si potrebbe istituire un fondo che aiuti i lavoratori in crisi. Potremmo unire le forze tutte insieme, secondo me è una bella cosa, vediamo.\"\n",

Nonostante la passione scoppiata fulminea tra i due, il fuoco di paglia era destinato a spegnersi fin troppo presto, con somma rassegnazione dell'ex gieffina che conferma la sua fama da \"sfortunata in amore\". Questa volta, a remare contro di lei sarebbe stata la sua stessa popolarità, quella che avrebbe finito per attirare Ciro coma una falena che vola verso la luce. La Tavassi, tuttavia, non è certo tipo da stare a guardare e sul suo profilo Facebook smaschera il giovane con accurata dovizia di particolari. Tra loro, impossibile non capirlo, sarebbe finita a causa dell'abitudine del sexy modello napoletano di viaggiare di fiore in fiore.\n",

Anche in Italia molti utenti si sono messi in fila già dalla serata di ieri per essere sicuri di poter acquistare lo smartphone Apple al DayOne visto che le unità disponibili sono limitate. A San Francisco, inoltre, i problemi potrebbero essere maggiori visto che nella giornata di ieri un gruppo di ladri ha assaltato un furgone della UPS che si stava recando all’Apple Store Stonestown di San Francisco per consegnare i dispositivi. Secondo quanto riportato dai giornalisti di CNET, infatti, un gruppo di malintenzionati ha intercettato il furgone diretto al negozio Apple ed ha sottratto oltre 300 iPhone X che sono poi stati caricati su un van bianco per poi far perdere le tracce. Sulla vicenda stanno ora indagando gli agenti delle forze dell'ordine che hanno raccolto le testimonianze di diverse persone ed acquisito filmati girati dagli smartphone dei passati che potrebbero essere utili per identificare i responsabili del furto che supera i 370.000 dollari.\n",

      "Centrodestra avanti, centrosinistra in seconda e Movimento 5 Stelle in terza. Questo è quanto emerge dal ‘Rapporto Roma, verso le elezioni comunali’ realizzato da Tecnè per Adnkronos. Il sondaggio sulle elezioni comunali 2021 prende in considerazione alcuni possibili candidati per il centrodestra, in base ai quali cambiano (anche se di poco) le percentuali che otterrebbero Virginia Raggi, Carlo Calenda e Roberto Gualtieri. Come è noto, infatti, il centrodestra non ha ancora un candidato: sono diversi i nomi fatti in questi mesi, ma per ora nessuna certezza. Il sondaggio, spiega AdnKronos, è stato realizzato su un campione rappresentativo della popolazione maggiorenne residente a Roma. Oltre 14mila le persone intervistate. Sempre secondo quanto rilevato dal sondaggio preso in esame, l'amministrazione Raggi sarebbe \"bocciata senza appello\" dal 70% del campione. Il 28% si è espresso in modo positivo, mentre il 2% non ha voluto dare una risposta. Per il centrodestra Tecnè ha preso in considerazione una rosa di candidati. I nomi sono quelli di Enrico Michetti, Giulia Bongiorno, Fabio Rampelli, Simonetta Matone, Claudio Graziano e Maurizio Gasparri. I favoriti sono senza dubbio Michetti (che ha ottenuto il 35% delle preferenze) e Bongiorno (33%). Nel caso il candidato del centrodestra sia uno di loro due, il Pd e il M5s potrebbero non ottenere il Campidoglio. Con Michetti in campo Gualtieri si fermerebbe al 33%, con Bongiorno al 32%, mentre con le altre combinazioni è il candidato del Pd a risultare vincente. Se il centrodestra dovesse candidare Michetti, Gualtieri otterrebbe il 33%, Raggi il 18% e Calenda il 14%, con una percentuale di astenuti che si aggira intorno al 44%. Michetti avrebbe il maggior numero di preferenze a Roma sud, Gualtieri al centro, Raggi a Roma nord, Calenda a Roma nord e Roma centro. Se la candidata del centrodestra fosse invece Giulia Bongiorno, otterrebbe il 33%, Gualtieri il 32%, Raggi il 20% e Calenda il 15%. L'avvocata della Lega ottiene il maggior numero di preferenze a Roma ovest, Gualtieri al centro e a Roma est, Raggi a Roma nord e Calenda a Roma ovest.\n",

      "Kylie Jenner sarà pure la più piccola di casa Kardashian ma a quanto pare non ha nulla da invidiare alle sorelle più grandi, visto che è diventata la miliardaria self-made più giovane della storia. Certo, di recente si è detto che i dati da lei forniti fossero falsati, ma la cosa certa è che, grazie a prodotti cosmetici e di make-up, è stata capace di costruire un impero imprenditoriale che porta il suo nome. Vantando un conto in banca da capogiro, non bada a spese quando si parla di shopping e nelle ultime ore lo ha dimostrato per l'ennesima volta. Kylie ha attirato l'attenzione dei fan con un cambio look estremo. Dopo aver sfoggiato i capelli castano caramello per tutta la quarantena, di recente era tornata al nero corvino. Ieri, però, si è mostrata in un'inedita versione biondo platino con un long bob portato liscio. too good had to do a double take A post shared by Kylie 🤍 (@kyliejenner) on Jun 23, 2020 at 9:57pm PDT\n",

      "“Your Name.”, il film d’animazione di Makoto Shinkai (“Oltre le nuvole, il luogo promessoci”, “Il giardino delle parole”) che sta conquistando premi su premi, sarà nelle sale italiane il 23-24-25 gennaio, distribuito da Nexo Digital, nell’ambito dell’iniziativa “Stagione degli Anime al Cinema”. La pellicola racconta la storia di Mitsuha, una studentessa che sogna di trasferirsi a Tokyo e di Taki, uno studente che vive proprio a Tokyo e che lavora anche in un ristorante italiano. I loro destini sembrano incrociarsi inconsciamente quando la prima sognerà di essere un uomo che vive nella capitale giapponese, mentre Taki di essere una giovane ragazza che vive in una sperduta cittadina di montagna. Il film è stato un successo clamoroso in patria, dove ha raggiunto la cifra record di di 40 miliardi di yen d’incasso (quasi 164 milioni di euro!), attestandosi al secondo posto tra gli anime più visti di sempre, dopo “La città incantata”, del maestro Hayao Miyazaki. “Your Name.” È un appuntamento imperdibile per tutti gli amanti del genere, quindi affrettatevi a prenotare il vostro biglietto nelle sale disponibili. Mitsuha è una studentessa che vive in una piccola città rurale e desidera trasferirsi a Tokyo, nella grande metropoli dove ogni sogno si può realizzare. Taki è uno studente di liceo che vive proprio a Tokyo, ha un lavoro part-time in un ristorante italiano, ma vorrebbe lavorare nel campo dell’arte o dell’architettura. Una notte, Mitsuha sogna di essere un giovane uomo, si ritrova in una stanza che non conosce, ha nuovi amici e lo skyline di Tokyo si apre dinnanzi al suo sguardo. Nello stesso momento Taki sogna di essere una ragazzina che vive in una piccola città di montagna che non ha mai visitato. Ma quale sarà il segreto che si cela dietro questi strani sogni incrociati? I doppiatori dei personaggi, nella versione originale, sono Ryunosuke Kamiki (Taki Tachibana), Mone Kamishiraishi (Mitsuha Miyamizu), Masami Nagasawa (Miki Okudera), Etsuko Ichihara (Hitoha Miyamizu), Ryo Narita (Katsuhiko Teshigawara), Aoi Yūki (Sayaka Natori), Nobunaga Shimazaki (Tsukasa Fujii), Kaito Ishikawa (Shinta Takagi), Kanon Tani (Yotsuha Miyamizu), Masaki Terasoma (Toshiki Miyamizu), Sayaka Ohara (Futaba Miyamizu) e Kana Hanazawa (Yukari Yukino). Quelli italiani, invece, sono Manuel Meli (Taki Tachibana), Emanuela Ionica (Mitsuha Miyamizu), Ludovica Bebi (Miki Okudera), Lorenza Biella (Hitoha Miyamizu), Fabrizio Russotto (Katsuhiko Teshigawara), Elena Perino (Sayaka Natori), Emanuele Ruzza (Tsukasa Fujii), Gabriele Tacchi (Shinta Takagi), Giorgia Ionica (Yotsuha Miyamizu), Gerolamo Alchieri (Toshiki Miyamizu) e Chiara Colizzi (Yukari Yukino). 1. Lo scorso marzo, Shinkai ha scritto anche il libro omonimo, legato al film, pubblicato il 18 giugno 2016 da Kadokawa. 2. La colonna sonora, composta dai Radwimps, è stata rilasciata nell’agosto 2016 ed è stata un successo clamoroso. Solo nella prima settimana, ha venduto 58.000 copie e ha vinto il 2° premio nella categoria Miglior colonna sonora ai Newtype Anime Awards del 2016. 3. Oltre al Giappone, il film è stato già distribuito in Cina, Corea del Sud, Thailandia, Francia, Australia, Regno Unito e Nuova Zelanda. 4. In Cina, paese che ha adottato una politica governativa per consentire la visualizzazione di solo 34 film stranieri all'anno, il film ha ottenuto un permesso speciale per essere visto già dalla fine dell'anno.\n",

      "Elisabetta Canalis ha rimediato una brutta figura a causa dei suoi amati cagnolini. La ex-velina, ormai compagna ufficiale di George Clooney, è andata a trovare il fidanzato sul set di\"The American\", il nuovo film che Clooney sta girando per la regia di Anton Corbijn e avrebbe lasciato incustoditi i suoi due cagnolini, Andrea e Vittorio, che, approfittando della libertà, si sono divertiti a disseminare dei \"ricordini\" non proprio piacevoli per tutto il set. A riportare la notizia è stato il settimanale Daily Mirror, citando una fonte, probabilmente un componente dello staff che al giornale ha riferito: \"Elisabetta ha un cucciolo chiamato Andrea e un bull terrier che si chiama Vittorio. I due hanno sporcato ovunque\". La fonte avrebbe quindi anche fatto lasciar intendere che Elisabetta non si sarebbe minimamente preoccupata di raccogliere quanto lasciato dai suoi adorati animali, forse pensando che qualcun'altro lo avrebbe fatto al suo posto. In ogni modo i cagnolini della Canalis non sono stati gli unici a creare scompigli sui set. Celebre è rimasta la rivolta scatenata dallo yorkshire di Britney Spears sul set di un servizio fotografico per la rivista OK nel 2007. Pare, infatti, che in quell'occasione Britney, al culmine del suo esaurimento nervoso, avrebbe addirittura usato un abito di Chanel per pulire i bisogni lasciati dal cane sul pavimento. E come non ricordare il recente incidente occorso alla cantante Mariah Carey con il suo amato jack russell terrier ChaCha. Mariah si stava godendo un bel bagno in vasca quando il suo adorato cagnolino le ha rovinato il momento di relax. A raccontarlo è stata la stessa cantante sul suo profilo Twitter.\n",

E invece ho fatto bene a forzare la mano con i medici, per esserci… per voi e per me… Ora aspetto di sapere, da voi, come avrete vissuto questo viaggio nel tempo e nella musica che ogni sera porterò in scena!\". \"C'è una grande storia che racconterò a parole, con aneddoti e suonando canzoni, quindi dal R&R ai Pink Floyd, ai Pooh, passando per i Rolling Stones e Bob Dylan\" ha detto l'ex Pooh ai microfoni di Fanpage.it parlando del tour: \"Racconterò la mia storia e racconterò la grande storia della musica\". Protagonista al Festival di Sanremo con \"Ognuno ha il suo racconto\", singolo che ha lanciato l'album \"Testimone del tempo\", l'ex Beatles ha spiegato come è nato questo suo lavoro extra Pooh per cui si è avvalso di autori importanti: \"L'album musicalmente ho voluto mettere dentro tutti quei segnali che hanno formato la mia maniera di vivere la musica, ci sono i Beatles, c'è il prog, poi ho cercato autori più cantautorali e sono arrivati Ruggeri, Ivano Fossati, poi ho conosciuto Vincenzo Incenzo insieme a Renato Zero perché serviva un visionario. E così ho cercato i miei autori un po' in base alla musica\". Se c'è qualcosa che non manca al musicista è senza dubbio la curiosità. Canzian cita spesso tra i suoi ascolti molta musica contemporanea e la spiegazione è molto semplice: \"Io ascolto tutto perché credo che l'errore che hanno fatto i nostri genitori sia stato quello di continuare ad ascoltare Claudio Villa e non ascoltare i Beatles, non stavano al passo coi tempi. Dai giovani arriva il meglio di quello che sarà il futuro, perché io sono stato interprete di quel meglio\".\n",

      "Fabrizio Corona sarà ospite non presente a Verissimo, il prossimo sabato, con Silvia Toffanin che gli dedicherà buona parte della puntata, a quasi un anno dalla sua seconda incarcerazione che, come ricordiamo, prevede una durata di poco più di sette anni. Per l'occasione è stato proprio l'ex paparazzo ad inviare una lettera completa in cui illustra il percorso di redenzione a cui ha deciso di iniziarsi, dimostra un animo piuttosto sereno ed indulgente anche nei confronti di chi lo ha condannato e chi lo ha criticato negli ultimi mesi. Al centro della sua lettera anche quella malattia, la depressione monopolare, di cui si è scoperto affetto da qualche mese e che sta curando con psicofarmaci: Io non provo più rabbia né rancore per chi mi ha condannato e inflitto questa pena così eccessiva e così assurda, ma anzi lo ringrazio perché mi ha dato la possibilità di capire tante cose, mi ha aiutato a riconoscere i tanti sbagli, ad ammettere gli errori, a guardarmi dentro, nel profondo della mia anima e capire finalmente, a quasi quarant'anni, chi sono e cosa voglio veramente Corona sottolinea anche le condizioni disumane di trattamento riservate ai detenuti (\"la realtà dell'inferno in terra, dove colpevoli ed innocenti sono costretti a vivere in condizioni vergognose e disumane nell'indifferenza istituzionale\"), ma evitare atteggiamenti rancorosi è l'obiettivo principale previsto dal percorso che ha deciso di iniziare, un percorso che prevede anche una cura intensa per il male che lo affligge: \"Continuo a combattere come ho fatto dal primo giorno che sono entrato in questo nuovo mondo, con questa nuova vita, per dimostrare che nei momenti di difficoltà si deve niente affatto ripiegare le ali, abbassare il tiro, ma anzi, tentare di rilanciarsi lavorando sui propri margini di miglioramento\".\n",

      "Tutto quello che accade ad Aurora Ramazzotti fa notizia. La figlia di Eros e Michelle Hunziker è una stella del web, al punto da essere stata scelta per condurre la striscia quotidiana di X Factor, pur non avendo mai avuto alcuna esperienza televisiva. Sono la sua notorietà e il gran numero di followers a parlare al suo posto, regalandole un potere mediatico di cui è l’unica a godere se si prendono in esame i figli dei vip più famosi. Aurora è la regina dei “figli d’arte”, quella che il pubblico segue di più e con maggiore affetto. Ne è felice la mamma Michelle Hunziker che dichiara di non temere affatto la popolarità di sua figlia. Intervistate dal settimanale “Io donna”, confermano che il loro, più che un rapporto tra madre e figlia, è il legame tra due donne che si amano e che sono cresciute insieme. Quando la Hunziker è rimasta incinta per la prima volta era giovanissima e il divorzio da Eros – insieme a tutti gli “errori di percorso” vissuti in quegli anni – l’ha spinta a crescere in fretta. Lo ha fatto insieme alla sua primogenita, al punto che l’affetto che le lega oggi è indissolubile. “Mia figlia più famosa di me? È la vita” dice orgogliosa Michelle a proposito di quella figlia che, appena 18enne, è già diventata famosissima ma che, pur dovendo gestire la notorietà, è riuscita a mantenere la testa sulle spalle. Anche Aurora nutre una stima profonda nei confronti di sua madre. La moglie di Tomaso Trussardi è una continua fonte di ispirazione per la giovane figlia, che ammette di avere ancora bisogno dei suoi consigli soprattutto in fatto di look: “Non esco di casa senza i suoi consigli sul look”. E a proposito della conduzione di X Factor – che le è valsa non poche polemiche – la figlia di Eros aggiunge: Sono prontissima per la mia esperienza. Ma non ho ancora iniziato, quindi vediamo.\n",

      "\"Signori, avete commesso un grave errore. Alcuni diranno che è avidità, altri disprezzano, arroganza … c'è ancora tempo per cambiare idea. Tutti commettono errori\". Si è concluso così l'intervento del presidente dell'UEFA Aleksander Ceferin al congresso della massima organizzazione del calcio europeo. Il dirigente sloveno ha provato a tendere la mano ai club fondatori della Super League e ha proposto loro di tornare indietro rispetto al percorso intrapreso, sottolineando come le competizioni per club che partiranno dal 2024 siano frutto di un lavoro ambizioso e condiviso dalla maggioranza delle federazioni. Ceferin nel suo intervento ha toccato vari punti, tra i quali c'è la sostenibilità economica correlata al risultato sportivo: “Per alcuni perdere non è più un risultato sportivo ma un rischio industriale, che non vogliono più assumersi. L’obiettivo non è più conquistare trofei, ma riempire il conto in banca. I soldi sono diventati più importanti della gloria e della lealtà”. In merito ai criteri che che dovrebbero regolare la nascente Superlega, Ceferin si è dilungato in un lungo excursus storico delle competizioni europee: \"Dobbiamo mantenere il sogno vivo. I grandi club non erano grandi un tempo e non c'è garanzia lo siano in futuro. Il calcio non è prevedibile, questo lo rende così popolare. Guardate al Manchester United prima di Ferguson, la Juventus era in Serie B quindici anni fa. Il calcio ha bisogno di squadre come Atalanta, Celtic, Dinamo Zagabria. Con questo sistema non avremmo avuto Nottingham Forrest, Amburgo, Porto, Stella Rossa. Alcuni non capiscono, se non guardando al conto in banca. Chi pensa di essere intoccabile dovrebbe ricordare da dove viene e ricordare che se oggi è grande è in parte merito dell'Uefa\". Il numero uno dell'UEFA non ha fatto mancare l'ennesima stoccata ad Andrea Agnelli: \"Alcuni amministratori delegati cambiano squadra come cambiano le loro maglie\".\n",

Guardate al Manchester United prima di Ferguson, la Juventus era in Serie B quindici anni fa. Il calcio ha bisogno di squadre come Atalanta, Celtic, Dinamo Zagabria. Con questo sistema non avremmo avuto Nottingham Forrest, Amburgo, Porto, Stella Rossa. Alcuni non capiscono, se non guardando al conto in banca. Chi pensa di essere intoccabile dovrebbe ricordare da dove viene e ricordare che se oggi è grande è in parte merito dell'Uefa\". Il numero uno dell'UEFA non ha fatto mancare l'ennesima stoccata ad Andrea Agnelli: \"Alcuni amministratori delegati cambiano squadra come cambiano le loro maglie\".\n",

      "    - \"Signori, avete commesso un grave errore. Alcuni diranno che è avidità, altri disprezzano, arroganza … c'è ancora tempo per cambiare idea. Tutti commettono errori\". Si è concluso così l'intervento del presidente dell'UEFA Aleksander Ceferin al congresso della massima organizzazione del calcio europeo. Il dirigente sloveno ha provato a tendere la mano ai club fondatori della Super League e ha proposto loro di tornare indietro rispetto al percorso intrapreso, sottolineando come le competizioni per club che partiranno dal 2024 siano frutto di un lavoro ambizioso e condiviso dalla maggioranza delle federazioni. Ceferin nel suo intervento ha toccato vari punti, tra i quali c'è la sostenibilità economica correlata al risultato sportivo: “Per alcuni perdere non è più un risultato sportivo ma un rischio industriale, che non vogliono più assumersi. L’obiettivo non è più conquistare trofei, ma riempire il conto in banca. I soldi sono diventati più importanti della gloria e della lealtà”.

      "L'edizione che verrà del talent show Amici sarà ricca di novità. Oltre ai soliti baby talenti in cerca di notorietà e affermazione nel mondo dello spettacolo ci saranno i professori ad accompagnarli nella loro crescita professionale. Tra questi però ne mancherà uno che ha fatto la storia di Amici al pari di Maria de Filippi: si tratta di Steve La Chance che sarà sostituito da Luciano Cannito, compagno di Rossella Brescia. Pare che non saranno in molti a sentire la mancanza dell'ex ballerino: per Garrison Rochelle ad Amici contano i ragazzi ed è giusto che ci sia un ricambio dopo tanti anni. Avvelenata la risposta di Steve la Chance: “il rinnovo del cast riguarda solo, stranamente, i professori che non diventano amici intimi della De Filippi” avrebbe detto alla stampa. Per qualcuno La Chance sarebbe finito sotto accusa per aver ostentato un ciondolo di marca facendo pubblicità occulta durante tutte le puntate ma ora spuntano nuove chicche: pare che Steve abbia convinto molti ragazzi ad iscriversi alla sua scuola di ballo alimentando la loro speranza di entrare ad Amici. Insomma la sua scuola sarebbe stata una “corsia preferenziale” per chi sognava di partecipare alla trasmissione di Canale 5. Il diretto interessato ovviamente ha smentito, ma intanto è fuori dalla scuola di talenti più famosa d'Italia. Insieme a lui non ci saranno Maura Papa mamma da poco e il presunto amante di Ricky Martin Valerio Pino. Il giovane ballerino invece ha pagato care le dichiarazioni shock in cui ha ammesso di aver fatto sesso negli studi televisivi: “Durante questa edizione – ha confidato di recente- nei pochi momenti liberi, facevo l'amore in camerino e dietro le quinte” ha ammesso senza dichiarare con chi. Ma tanto è bastato perchè Valerio Pino fosse escluso dal cast. Tutt'altra storia invece quella di Stefano De Martino professionista ad Amici dopo il successo e i complimenti dello scorso anno: per poterlo ammirare Emma Marrone e i suoi fans dovranno però aspettare l'inizio del serale del talent show.\n",

      "A due anni dal chiacchieratissimo divorzio da Brad Pitt, ecco che si torna a parlare di Angelina Jolie. La diva americana è al centro dell'attenzione nelle ultime ore, dopo l'uscita di un'indiscrezione che la vorrebbe al fianco di un nuovo amore: il fortunato, si dice, sarebbe Garrett Hedlund, fascinoso attore più giovane di lei di nove anni. Peccato che la notizia, che ha fatto rapidamente anche il giro dei media italiani, sarebbe clamorosamente falsa. Il presunto scoop, benché ripreso in tutto il mondo, è da attribuirsi a Radar Online, sito tristemente noto per la diffusione di bufale e notizie azzardate. Per capirci, fu proprio questo portale ad annunciare nel lontano 2016 che Cher sarebbe stata in fin di vita (la cantante, per fortuna, è tuttora viva e vegeta) e a parlare di violenze da parte di Michael Jackson ai suoi nipoti, che puntualmente hanno smentito. Così Radar Online, citando una sedicente fonte, ha parlato della presunta vicinanza tra la Jolie e Hedlund: \"Si sono scambiati email, poi si sono dati un appuntamento a cena. È Garrett ad aver preso in mano la situazione. Angelina è incredibilmente lusingata e si sta godendo le attenzioni di Garrett. È come avere accanto un Brad più giovane e passionale. Sarebbe una bella rivincita romantica per lei\". A negare tutto, ci pensa un altro giornale online, Gossip Cop, particolarmente abile nell'individuazione di rumors e false notizie. \"Un portavoce di Hedlund ha confermato in esclusiva a Gossip Cop che non c'è alcuna verità in quelle affermazioni riguardanti una relazione\", riporta il sito, che precisa come Hedlund, dalla fine della relazione con Kristen Dunst nel 2016, non avrebbe più avuto relazioni importanti. Lo stesso Radar Online, anzi, lo scorso anno sostenne che l'attore 33enne si fosse legato a Diane Kruger, notizia rivelatasi poi, anch'essa, falsa.\n",

      "“Poltergeist – Demoniache presenze” è il film horror del 1982, diretto da Tobe Hooper, co-scritto e prodotto da Steven Spielberg, che ebbe un successo clamoroso e riuscì a portare a casa anche tre nomination agli Oscar. La pellicola incassò quasi 77 milioni di dollari solo negli USA. Negli anni successivi, la produzione decise di girare anche due sequel: “Poltergeist II – L'altra dimensione” (1986) e “Poltergeist III – Ci risiamo” (1988) e nel 1996 è stata realizzata anche la serie televisiva “Poltergeist”, consistente in uno spin-off del film, che ottenne anche un ottimo riscontro di pubblico. Pochi mesi fa, è stato rilasciato l’angosciante trailer del reboot di Sam Raimi e del regista Gil Kenan, ma forse non tutti sanno che un’inquietante storia di morti aleggia attorno agli attori della prima trilogia. In una lunga intervista rilasciata al Daily Mail, l’attore Oliver Robins, che all’epoca aveva solo 9 anni, interpretava il ruolo di Robbie Freeling, fratello terrorizzato di Heather O’Rourke (Carol Anne Freeling), la ragazzina posseduta, ha voluto dire la sua sulla leggendaria maledizione che aleggia sul film, da sempre. Dopo le riprese, e negli anni a venire, infatti, gli attori principali del cast sono morti tragicamente. L’attore, oggi regista 43enne, a tal proposito, ha detto: A dire il vero, io credo che nessuno degli attori o degli addetti ai lavori di “Poltergeist” ha preso mai sul serio questa storia della maledizione. Io penso che non ci sia alcuna maledizione, si tratta solo di tragiche coincidenze. Non ne ho mai parlato neanche con Steven Spielberg, ma credo che lui la pensi come me. Semmai, tutta questa storia non ha fatto altro che aumentare il successo del film e, forse, per questo hanno pensato di farne un remake? Naturalmente, Robins potrebbe avere anche ragione, ma è davvero inspiegabile il fatto che cinque attori legati al primo film, e ai successivi sequel, siano morti tragicamente. La prima a perdere la vita fu proprio Heather O'Rourke, che recitò nel ruolo della piccola Carol Anne Freeling. La bimba perse la vita a soli 12 anni per una rara malattia intestinale, poco prima dell'uscita dell'ultimo film della serie. Durante un intervento, la bambina morì per arresto cardiaco. Di lei Robin ha un ricordo vividissimo, dato che erano molto amici e si frequentavano anche fuori dal set. La sua morte lo devastò, lasciando in lui un enorme vuoto.\n",

Il nuovo provvedimento, che arriverà domani in Consiglio dei ministri, è considerato una vittoria personale dal segretario della Lega Matteo Salvini, che però intende continuare a dare battaglia: \"Dopo essere riuscita ad ottenere le riaperture di tutte le attività all'aperto dal 26 aprile, il ritorno alla vita nelle Regioni (gialle e bianche) con situazione sotto controllo e la possibilità di spostarsi fra Regioni, la Lega proporrà in Consiglio dei Ministri e in Parlamento, in accordo con sindaci, governatori e associazioni, la riapertura dai primi di maggio anche delle attività al chiuso e l'estensione almeno fino alle 23 della possibilità di uscire\". La bozza del nuovo decreto, che dovrebbe restare in vigore fino al prossimo 31 luglio, ha confermato infatti il coprifuoco dalle 22 alle 5. E l'idea di spostare il divieto di circolazione di un'ora in avanti, per agevolare i clienti della ristorazione, è stata una richiesta avanzata anche dai governatori all'incontro con l'esecutivo sulle riaperture. Dal 26 aprile infatti, con il ripristino delle zone gialle, potranno ripartire anche bar e ristoranti, con una novità: potranno aprire anche a cena ma solo se dispongono di tavoli all'aperto. Mentre secondo la road map indicata dal decreto i ristoranti al chiuso dovranno aspettare il 1 giugno per poter riaprire. Nel testo si specifica che, solo in zona gialla, la ristorazione sarà permessa al chiuso, \"con consumo al tavolo\" dalle ore 5 del mattino alle 18, \"o fino a un diverso orario stabilito con deliberazione del Consiglio dei ministri\". Altro successo rivendicato dal Carroccio è la possibilità di spostarsi nuovamente da una Regione all'altra – non solo tra Regioni gialle, ma anche arancioni o rosse – grazie anche ai ‘certificati verdi', che attestano l'avvenuta vaccinazione, la guarigione dal Covid-19, oppure \"l'effettuazione di un test molecolare o antigenico rapido con risultato negativo al virus SARS CoV-2\".\n",

      "L'app Immuni è finalmente online. Dopo mesi di anticipazione, settimane di sviluppo e giorni di attesa, uno degli strumenti più importanti per il contenimento delle nuove potenziali ondate di coronavirus è finalmente disponibile per il download su smartphone. Di Immuni è già stato detto tutto: da chi ha sviluppato l'app a quali saranno le garanzie per la privacy di chi la scaricherà, fino a come funzionerà a grandi linee. Da pochi minuti però il software è disponibile sia per gli smartphone Android sia per gli iPhone e si appresta al suo primo banco di prova Immuni è stata pubblicata negli store digitali di Android e iOS, ovvero il Play Store di Google e l'App Store di Apple. Nelle due vetrine virtuali si trovano i collegamenti che scaricano e installano in automatico e gratuitamente l'app. Dopo il download e l'installazione il software si troverà in attesa nella schermata iniziale del telefono o in quella delle app. Come anticipato dal viceministro Sileri pochi giorni fa, l'app per il momento è ancora in fase beta, ovvero preliminare. Il codice insomma è completo, ma gli sviluppatori devono ancora affinarne il funzionamento per renderlo compatibile con gli svariati milioni di smartphone che utilizzeranno la piattaforma in contemporanea. Per questo motivo è stata istituita una sperimentazione che coinvolgerà inizialmente solo quattro regioni — ovvero Puglia, Marche, Abruzzo e Liguria (che però si è sfilata all'ultimo dalla partecipazione). Gli abitanti di queste regioni potranno installare e utilizzare Immuni già a partire dalle prossime ore, mentre i cittadini delle altre regioni dovranno attendere. L'app si potrà ugualmente scaricare da tutta Italia recandosi su App Store e Play Store, ma al di fuori delle regioni interessate le sue funzioni di contact tracing non funzioneranno. Come anticipato già da settimane, l'app non non utilizza il GPS né altre funzioni che possano mettere a repentaglio la privacy degli utenti. Per tracciare i contatti dei potenziali nuovi contagiati sfrutta un intelligente sistema fatto di codici generati casualmente dagli smartphone, scambiati tra tutti i dispositivi attraverso connessioni Bluetooth a risparmio energetico. Immuni si occupa di tutto in automatico, lasciando il compito di interagire con l'app solamente in due scenari. Nel caso di contatto prolungato con un caso rilevato come positivo, gli utenti ricevono una notifica dall'app che li avvisa del rischio; nel caso sviluppino sintomi o siano rilevati positivi dal sistema sanitario, gli utenti possono invece decidere di tenere un diario della malattia all'interno dell'app, allertando così i loro contatti in modo completamente anonimo.\n",

      "Nell'ultima settimana di luglio la classifica non cambia per quanto riguarda la prima posizione, sebbene le bocce ferme di questa stagione di uscite scarse, permette ad alcuni album di risalire la china, grazie anche agli ascolti in streaming, diventato, ormai, come dicono anche i numeri ufficiali diramati pochi giorni fa dalla FIMI, leader del mercato digitale con il 51%, portando il digitale sempre più su. Al primo posto della classifica, infatti, continua a esserci \"Plume\", ultimo album di Irama, vincitore dell'ultime edizione di Amici di Maria De Filippi, che da otto settimane, ovvero dal'uscita, sosta in testa tra gli album più venduti. Al secondo posto risale Drake, che la settimana scorsa col suo \"Scorpion\" era in undicesima posizione, e si mette alle spalle Capoplaza e il suo \"20\", album che sosta da settimane in top 10, così come il \"Notti brave\" di Carl Brave che questa settimana è quarto davanti a \"Davide\" di Gemitaiz e a \"Rockstar\" di Sfera Ebbasta, album chje da 27 settimane è nelle posizioni alte della classifica ed è, inoltre, il più venduto della prima metà del 2017. Risale Emma Muscat che con \"Moments\" passa dalla decima posizione alla settima, respingendo il ritorno di Ultimo, che risale in ottava con \"Peter Pan\" e soprattutto della Pausini che dopo il doppio concerto al Circo Massimo guadagna 11 posizioni passando dalla 20 alla nove e tornando, quindi, in top 10 davanti a Biondo, altro ex Amici, con \"Dejavu\".\n",

Delusa dalla forza della natura che ha rovinato i suoi sogni, la Canalis ha pensato bene di partire per il Libano come ambasciatrice dell'Unicef per la vaccinazione dei bambini più disagiati, ovvero circa il 20% della popolazione infantile mondiale, e ha aderito all'onorevole missione \"100% Vacciniamoli Tutti\". La prima tappa del suo viaggio umanitario è stata nel centro educativo di Nabatieh, a 60 Km da Beirut. Qui ha incontrato i suoi \"piccoli amici\" con i quali ha scattato foto, si è intrattenuta ai tavoli di gioco e ha disegnando tornendo un po' bambina. \"Una delle esperienze più stimolanti della mia vita\", in questo modo ha commentato il viaggio appena intrapreso e ha aggiunto \"Grazie @Unicef per questo meraviglioso regalo\".\n",

In tutto, i 4 film son riusciti ad incassare quasi 3 miliardi di dollari, quindi era inevitabile che la 20th Century Fox tornasse a cavalcare l’onda di questo sicuro successo, soprattutto in un periodo in cui i film d’animazione stanno facendo scintille al botteghino, vedi “Minions” e “Inside Out”.

      "L'Isola dei Famosi 2010 è stata vinta da Daniele Battaglia e a distanza di poco più di un mese già iniziano i primi rumors sui prossimi concorrenti. Il toto- isola durerà presumibilmente fino alla settimana prima dell'inizio del reality, per cui meglio rassegnarsi fin da ora alle migliaia di nomi che si rincorreranno di personaggi famosi e non famosi. L'Isola e la sua conduttrice Simona Ventura sono da sempre aperti tutto: dallo spettacolo alla politica ogni vip è benvenuto: basti pensare a Vladimir Luxuria o al figlio d'arte Francesco Facchinetti. A volte i nomi sono solo frutto di fantasia, a volte invece c'è qualcosa di concreto come nel caso di Anna Tatangelo ed Elio vicini alla fima a X Factor. E il caso di Clemente Mastella a L'Isola dei Famosi 8? E' stata solo una battuta o c'è del vero? Non svela l'arcano la Ventura, intervistata da A in edicola domani ha detto la sua sincera e schietta come al solito. \"La litigata di Berlusconi e Fini davanti alle telecamere non era forse un reality? E le primarie non sono un altro reality? La comunicazione politica in Italia è molto cambiata, si deve prenderne atto. Il problema è piuttosto la sostanza, che resta melmosa\" ha detto senza troppi peli sulla lingua. Ma Simona ha rincarato la dose e intervenuta a proposito delle indagini che hanno coinvolto Diego Anemone e Magnolia, produttrice di X Factor e de L'Isola dei Famosi ha detto: \"Io Anemone ce lo porterei sull'isola\". E conoscendola c'è da giurarci che non l'ha detto tanto per dire qualcosa. Simona Ventura ha difeso a spada tratta la sua trasmissione e Magnolia indagata per illeciti: \"La Procura di Milano ha chiarito che non c'è alcuna inchiesta riguardante l'Isola dei famosi. Secondo: so chi c'è dietro queste sporche manovre. Problemi loro. Per quanto mi riguarda, non voglio fare polemiche con chi prova a mettersi in gara con me\".\n",

L'opera risultante ha creato una sorta di inversione della mappa stellare in larga scala sul ghiaccio dell'Antartide. Come la Terra ruota sul suo asse e gira intorno al Sole, il rapporto tra le sfere e le loro stelle sorelle cambia. Il doppio movimento di rotazione della Terra e la sua orbita portano le sfere e le stelle fuori allineamento. Lo spostamento tra le posizioni originali delle stelle e le sfere traccia una spirale invisibile al polo della terra.

      " Nel 2006, l'artista californiana Lita Albuquerque ha guidato una spedizione fino agli estremi confini dell'Antartide, vicino al Polo Sud, per realizzare la prima tappa del suo lavoro globale Stellar Axis. La spedizione, finanziata dalla National Science Foundation, ha creata la prima e più grande opera d'arte effimera del continente antartico. L'installazione consiste in una serie di novantanove sfere blu 99 sfere blu disposte sul ghiaccio polare in perfetto allineamento con novantanove stelle di una costellazione nel cielo sopra l'Antartide. Il posizionamento di ciascuna sfera corrisponde al posizione di una specifica stella. Il diametro di ogni sfera corrisponde alla luminosità relativa della stella a cui è allineata. L'opera risultante ha creato una sorta di inversione della mappa stellare in larga scala sul ghiaccio dell'Antartide. Come la Terra ruota sul suo asse e gira intorno al Sole, il rapporto tra le sfere e le loro stelle sorelle cambia. Il doppio movimento di rotazione della Terra e la sua orbita portano le sfere e le stelle fuori allineamento. Lo spostamento tra le posizioni originali delle stelle e le sfere traccia una spirale invisibile al polo della terra. Stellar Axis non è statica, è un marcatore di tempo e di moto costante,che noi raramente percepiamo.\n",

      "La caduta in picchiata e poi l'esplosione. Un video di pochi secondi pubblicato dal \"Corriere della sera\" mostra gli istanti finali dell'incidente di domenica 3 ottobre, quando un aereo da turismo con otto persone a bordo si è schiantato contro un edificio in ristrutturazione vicino alla fermata della metro di San Donato Milanese, alle porte di Milano. Nel filmato, agli atti dell'inchiesta per disastro aereo aperta dalla Procura di Milano, si vede il Pilatus-Pc12 pilotato dal miliardario romeno Dan Petrescu cadere in verticale, completamente fuori controllo, contro l'edificio. Pochi istanti dopo lo schianto si vede una nuvola di fumo alzarsi dal luogo dell'impatto a seguito dell'esplosione del velivolo. Le immagini durano una manciata di secondi e sono state girate da un automobilista che in quel momento stava percorrendo la Tangenziale Est di Milano. Fissano l'orario esatto dello schianto, le 13.07. Queste, così come altre immagini che il procuratore aggiunto Tiziana Siciliano aveva già acquisito, serviranno ad aiutare gli inquirenti a capire cosa sia accaduto precisamente al pilota Dan Petrescu, che nel tragico incidente ha perso la vita assieme ad altre sette persone: la moglie Regina Dorotea Balzat Petrescu, il figlio di 30 anni, Dan Stefan, l'amico del figlio Julien Brossard e una famiglia composta dal 32enne Filippo Nascimbene, da sua moglie Claire Alexandrescou, dal loro figlio di appena un anno e dalla nonna del piccolo, Miruna Anca Wanda Lozinschi.\n",

      "L’ormai consueto appuntamento con la love story tra Nando e Margherita si ripresenta puntuale anche questo lunedì. Ci eravamo lasciati una settimana fa, al momento in cui Margherita sceglie di credere a Nando, dopo essersi confrontata con le versioni diversissime del pometino e di Alessandra Correale, l’uno dicendo di non averla mai tradita, l’altra asserendo il contrario. Avevamo ritrovato una Margherita nuovamente confusa durante la settimana, tanto da scatenare una furiosa lite con Guenda su Nando, perchè i nuovi dubbi le avevano fatto implicitamente chiedere al Gf di rivederlo per poi rimandare la concessione dell'eventuale grazia al fuori, cosa che secondo Guenda finiva per tirare troppo la corda. Ed invece è esattamente quanto accade oggi. Non solo il Grande Fratello 11 serve Nando su un piatto d’argento a Margherita, ma organizza persino una seduta scientificamente comprovata dalla macchina della verità. Andiamo con ordine. Innanzitutto Margherita viene invitata a raggiungere la stanza delle sorprese, dove l’attende un ologramma di Nando riflesso in uno specchio. Parte l’apologia di Nando Colelli: “ciao Chicchè, che stai a fa? Tutto a posto? Mi manchi tanto. Ti sento sempre. Mi manchi veramente. Ti amo. Non sto scherzando”. La via scelta è insomma un tentativo di evitare la figura da stoccafisso dell’ultimo incontro con Margherita sostituendo all’imbarazzo una innaturale parlantina. Margherita Zanatta è a metà tra l’incredulo e lo scettico, e si appiglia ad un monologo già meditato in settimana: “Dovrei essere arrabbiata nera con te, lo sono stata, ti ho odiato da pazzi, ma c'è un problema. Che sono innamorata di te. Quando uscirò dobbiamo parlare di un sacco di cose”. Finisce qui la prima parte del confronto. La seconda consiste in un test scientifico per stabilire la veridicità delle affermazioni di Nando negli ultimi tempi. Si risolve in un’assoluta debacle del pometino. Vi riproponiamo in serie tutte le domande, con relative risposte, risultate tutte menzognere tranne una: 1) quando eri nella casa hai mai desiderato un'altra? “No” 2) subito dopo la tua uscita dalla casa hai lasciato Margherita con una lettera in cui scrivevi: “non ti ho più dentro”. Sono stati i fischi del pubblico a farti cambiare idea? “No”\n",

Gina Ingles, 34 anni, e suo figlio Milo sono morti in seguito a un incendio divampato nella loro casa di Eastbourne, in Inghilterra, nelle prime ore di martedì scorso. Mamma e figlio sono rimasti intrappolati nella camera da letto al primo piano della loro casa a due piani e i loro corpi sono stati trovati solo molte ore dopo l’incendio. Le successive autopsie hanno rivelato che sono morti a causa dell’inalazione di fumo. Toby Jarrett, compagno 26enne della donna, ha riportato gravi ustioni e attualmente è in coma farmacologico in ospedale. La signora Ingles è stata descritta dalla sua famiglia come una mamma a tempo pieno che amava le arti, il disegno e cucinare. Milo è stato invece descritto come un “giocoso, sfacciato e adorabile ragazzino divertente e pieno di sorrisi”.\n",

      "Quando arriva la bella stagione in molti si chiedono quali sono i colori di moda per la primavera. In molti prima di rifare il guardaroba per l'estate, e prima di scegliere i capi per le vacanze, cercano di capire quali sono le tonalità su cui puntare. Quest'anno le nuance di tendenza sono soprattutto quelle neutre e calde della terra, a dominare sono tutte le tonalità di marrone, dal tabacco al cappuccino, ma anche nuance più accese di arancio, fino ad arrivare al giallo limone e al rosso fragola. Tra le tonalità fredde spopola il blu in versione elettrica, il bianco ottico e il verde acido. Tornano poi di gran moda i colori fluo e le tonalità neon, che spuntano come funghi nelle collezioni dei grandi stilisti e si contrappongono a tenui colori pastello come il glicine, altra nuance di tendenza per la Primavera/Estate 2019. Riguardo ai colori, un altro grande trend riguarda il look total color, si tratta di completi realizzati con capi ed accessori tutti dello stesso colore. Da Fendi a Max Mara, da Versace a Gucci, sulle passerelle dei grandi stilisti italiani e internazionali spopolano gli outfit monocolore, realizzati con pezzi dalla tonalità identica o simile. Per essere cool quest'estate basta scegliere un abito dal colore deciso e senza fantasia, da abbinare ad accessori con tonalità simile. Osservando i look che hanno sfilato in passerella è possibile poi prendere ispirazione per i propri outfit, raccogliendo idee su colori di tendenza e abbinamenti di moda. Ecco dunque i colori alla moda per la Primavera/Estate 2019 e tutti i consigli per abbinarli nel modo giusto. Questa primavera i colori più cool sono quelli caldi e scuri delle terra, via dunque con tonalità bruciate di tabacco e marrone, di ecrù e cioccolato. Solitamente utilizzate per i look invernali, quest'anno queste tonalità diventano un must anche per la bella stagione e appaiono su jumpsuit e pantaloni a vita alta dai tessuti leggeri, su lunghi abiti da abbinare con sandali bassi e su trench e gonne plissé, proprio come nei look di Max Mara e Fendi. Da Ermanno Scervino gli abiti corti con ruche marroni sfilano abbinati a cuissardes di tonalità simili, mentre da Burberry giacche maschili dalle linee rigorose in marrone sono abbinate e pencil skirt color cappuccino. Come abbinare il marrone – Le tonalità di marrone sono perfette per essere abbinate insieme tra di loro, creando un look monocolore di grande tendenza. Le nuance scure possono essere smorzate con capi in verde militare, beige chiaro e bianco o persino con capi dai colori accesi come verde neon, giallo e arancione. Evitate l'accostamento del marrone scuro con il blu notte o con il nero poiché le tonalità non si sposano bene e il rischio è quello di creare un completo troppo scuro e invernale. Quali sono le tonalità più cool questa primavera? Senza dubbio quelle fluorescenti che hanno regnato sulle passerelle dei marchi più trendy e young tra cui Off-White e GCDS, dove abbiamo visto shirt neon abbinate a gonne pitonate in look total fluo e abitini stretch in verde acido o rosa shocking. Un fluo luminoso declinato in versione romantica appare, invece, nei look con gonne plissé e abiti in pizzo che hanno sfilato da Cristiano Burani e Blumarine. Come abbinare i colori neon – Se il vostro obiettivo è quello di creare un outfit vistoso e che non passi inosservato, magari per una serata in discoteca o in un club, potete accostare tonalità fluo a contrasto come verde e rosa o ancora verde e arancio. Se, al contrario, volete seguire il trend fluo senza però esagerare scegliete una shirt neon in giallo o verde da abbinare con un paio di jeans o con una giacca in denim. Le tonalità fluo risaltano anche se abbinate al nero o al bianco. Evitate accostamenti di capi fluo con capi e accessori realizzati con colori primari e decisi come il rosso, evitate anche accostamenti tra tonalità neon e nuance pastello. Il bianco quest'estate è ottico, dunque estremamente candido e luminoso, perfetto per creare outfit total white con camicie maschili e pantaloni palazzo, come nei look di DROMe, ma anche con top e minigonne asimmetriche, come nei look disegnati da Virgil Abloh per il suo marchio Off-White. Un bianco candido sfila anche da Dior, sugli abiti da sera, negli romantici look in pizzo di Elie Saab e nei look sporty couture di Fila. Come abbinare il bianco ottico – Il bianco, lo sappiamo bene, si abbina con tutto, è un vero e proprio passepartout. Quest'estate è di gran moda il look total white, dunque scegliete abiti e capi bianchi da abbinare tra loro e con borse e scarpe candide. Evitate l'accostamento tra bianco e beige o tra bianco ottico e tonalità di bianco sporco o crema.\n",

      "Quando arriva la bella stagione in molti si chiedono quali sono i colori di moda per la primavera. In molti prima di rifare il guardaroba per l'estate, e prima di scegliere i capi per le vacanze, cercano di capire quali sono le tonalità su cui puntare. Quest'anno le nuance di tendenza sono soprattutto quelle neutre e calde della terra, a dominare sono tutte le tonalità di marrone, dal tabacco al cappuccino, ma anche nuance più accese di arancio, fino ad arrivare al giallo limone e al rosso fragola. Tra le tonalità fredde spopola il blu in versione elettrica, il bianco ottico e il verde acido. Tornano poi di gran moda i colori fluo e le tonalità neon, che spuntano come funghi nelle collezioni dei grandi stilisti e si contrappongono a tenui colori pastello come il glicine, altra nuance di tendenza per la Primavera/Estate 2019. Riguardo ai colori, un altro grande trend riguarda il look total color, si tratta di completi realizzati con capi ed accessori tutti dello stesso colore. Da Fendi a Max Mara, da Versace a Gucci, sulle passerelle dei grandi stilisti italiani e internazionali spopolano gli outfit monocolore, realizzati con pezzi dalla tonalità identica o simile. Per essere cool quest'estate basta scegliere un abito dal colore deciso e senza fantasia, da abbinare ad accessori con tonalità simile. Osservando i look che hanno sfilato in passerella è possibile poi prendere ispirazione per i propri outfit, raccogliendo idee su colori di tendenza e abbinamenti di moda. Ecco dunque i colori alla moda per la Primavera/Estate 2019 e tutti i consigli per abbinarli nel modo giusto. Questa primavera i colori più cool sono quelli caldi e scuri delle terra, via dunque con tonalità bruciate di tabacco e marrone, di ecrù e cioccolato. Solitamente utilizzate per i look invernali, quest'anno queste tonalità diventano un must anche per la bella stagione e appaiono su jumpsuit e pantaloni a vita alta dai tessuti leggeri, su lunghi abiti da abbinare con sandali bassi e su trench e gonne plissé, proprio come nei look di Max Mara e Fendi. Da Ermanno Scervino gli abiti corti con ruche marroni sfilano abbinati a cuissardes di tonalità simili, mentre da Burberry giacche maschili dalle linee rigorose in marrone sono abbinate e pencil skirt color cappuccino. Come abbinare il marrone – Le tonalità di marrone sono perfette per essere abbinate insieme tra di loro, creando un look monocolore di grande tendenza. Le nuance scure possono essere smorzate con capi in verde militare, beige chiaro e bianco o persino con capi dai colori accesi come verde neon, giallo e arancione. Evitate l'accostamento del marrone scuro con il blu notte o con il nero poiché le tonalità non si sposano bene e il rischio è quello di creare un completo troppo scuro e invernale. Quali sono le tonalità più cool questa primavera? Senza dubbio quelle fluorescenti che hanno regnato sulle passerelle dei marchi più trendy e young tra cui Off-White e GCDS, dove abbiamo visto shirt neon abbinate a gonne pitonate in look total fluo e abitini stretch in verde acido o rosa shocking. Un fluo luminoso declinato in versione romantica appare, invece, nei look con gonne plissé e abiti in pizzo che hanno sfilato da Cristiano Burani e Blumarine. Come abbinare i colori neon – Se il vostro obiettivo è quello di creare un outfit vistoso e che non passi inosservato, magari per una serata in discoteca o in un club, potete accostare tonalità\n"

      "La sfera tenuta in mano da Gesù Cristo nel Salvator Mundi, la celebre opera di Leonardo da Vinci, è cava e non piena. Ciò spiega la ragione per cui non mostra i particolari segni di rifrazione e riflessione della luce che ci si aspetterebbe da un oggetto di quel tipo. Il mistero secolare è stato risolto da un team di ricerca americano dell'Università della California di Irvine, che si è avvalso di una particolare tecnica di computer grafica (chiamata rendering inverso) per dimostrare le caratteristiche del globo tenuto dal Salvatore del Mondo, e che dunque Leonardo non si era preso \"licenze poetiche\" per realizzare l'opera. Sino ad oggi molti studiosi ritenevano che Leonardo da Vinci avesse dipinto la sfera in modo irrealistico volontariamente, per un qualche motivo artistico/filosofico a noi ignoto. Tuttavia Leonardo era un esperto conoscitore di fenomeni ottici, come si evince dai numerosi appunti lasciati ai posteri; un dettaglio del genere, dunque, non sarebbe sfuggito alle sue esigenze di precisione e realismo, cuore pulsante delle sue molteplici e poliedriche opere. Da qui il mistero di quell'orbe così strano e misterioso, non in linea con la “firma” dello scienziato, artista e inventore toscano. Grazie alla modellazione della scena del Salvator Mundi attraverso il software di rendering 3D Maya, gli scienziati guidati dal professor Marco (Zhanhang) Liang del Dipartimento di Informatica sono riusciti a dimostrare che tutto era stato eseguito a regola d'arte. Con la tecnica del rendering inverso, nella quale i dettagli tridimensionali di una scena vengono ottenuti partendo da un'immagine bidimensionale, è stato calcolato che la sfera tenuta in mano da Gesù Cristo aveva un raggio di 6,8 centimetri e si trovava a 25 centimetri di distanza dal corpo, mentre il suo spessore era di 1,3 millimetri. Si tratta dunque di una sfera vuota. Proprio a causa della peculiare struttura le pieghe delle vesti di Cristo non risultano distorte o ingrandite, e risultano compatibili con una fonte di luce proveniente dall'alto che colpisce una sfera vuota. “I nostri esperimenti dimostrano che un rendering otticamente accurato che corrisponde qualitativamente al dipinto è effettivamente possibile utilizzando materiali, fonti di luce e conoscenze scientifiche disponibili per Leonardo da Vinci intorno al 1500. Abbiamo inoltre testato teorie alternative sulla composizione del globo, come quella della solida palla di calcite, ma è improbabile che tali alternative producano immagini simili a quelle del dipinto”, hanno sottolineato gli autori della ricerca.\n",

      "\"Nessuno al di fuori di questa chat, tantomeno Whatsapp, è in grado di leggere o ascoltare questi messaggi\". La piattaforma di messaggistica istantanea più famosa al mondo, che ormai conta più di 2 miliardi di utenti, ci tiene alla privacy di chi ogni giorno utilizza i suoi servizi. Ma un'inchiesta di ProPublica, organizzazione di giornalismo investigativo senza scopo di lucro, pubblicata il 7 settembre, rivela dettagli che farebbero pensare il contrario. A quanto pare, sarebbero \"più di 1000 i lavoratori a contratto che riempiono gli uffici di Austin, Texas, Dublino e Singapore, per esaminare milioni di contenuti prodotti dagli utenti\". Per farlo si avvalgono di sistemi di intelligenza artificiale e di software particolari. Questi lavoratori, assunti da Facebook, passano le giornate a setacciare i contenuti segnalati dagli utenti e dall'algoritmo del servizio di messaggistica. Tutto ciò accade anche in virtù del sistema di segnalazione, che permette agli utenti di far presente alla piattaforma una violazione del regolamento interno all'app. È attivo da mesi, ma verrà aggiornato nei prossimi giorni. La nuova versione prevede una novità. La quantità di messaggi segnalati che l'app inoltrerà ai moderatori sarà maggiore: si tratta di una \"micro cronologia degli ultimi 5 messaggi scambiati tra i contatti che hanno preso parte alla conversazione in questione. Questo limite dovrebbe aiutare i moderatori della piattaforma a comprendere il contesto nel quale è avvenuta una segnalazione senza invadere eccessivamente la privacy dei protagonisti\". O almeno, fino a qualche giorno fa, si pensava sarebbe stato così. Ma l'inchiesta di ProPublica ha cambiato le carte in tavola. Gli strumenti che i moderatori hanno a portata di mano permettono loro di accedere a fiumi di messaggi privati, immagini e video denunciati per vari motivi: spam, contenuti fraudolenti, pedopornografia e terrorismo. Sembra strano, ma il lavoro di valutazione dei contenuti richiede pochissimo tempo, circa 1 minuto. La paga di questi moderatori, reclutati grazie a un annuncio ambiguo – ciò che l'aspirante voyeur poteva leggere era soltanto \"ricerca sui contenuti\", ma di Facebook o WhatsApp non si aveva notizia – ammonta a 16,5 dollari all'ora. Una cifra invitante, certo, ma nella stessa è incluso un accordo di non divulgazione. Tanto che l'unica risposta che possono dare a chiunque ponga la fatidica domanda \"Per chi lavorate?\" è solo una risposta striminzita: \"per Accenture\", una multinazionale con sede legale a Dublino, operante nel settore della consulenza strategica. Ma, raggiunta dalle domande poste dai giornalisti di ProPublica, la stessa Accenture ha rifiutato di commentare. Rimane il fatto che i dati non crittografati – perché denunciati dall'utente – a cui hanno accesso i moderatori sono molti, forse troppi: i nomi e le immagini del profilo utente, numero di telefono, stato, livello della batteria, lingua e fuso orario, ID telefono, indirizzo IP e sistema operativo, potenza del segnale wireless, account Facebook e Instagram collegati, data dell'ultimo utilizzo dell'app e la cronologia violazioni.\n",

      "Dal 26 settembre al 21 febbraio lo splendido Chiostro del Bramante, a Roma a due passi da piazza Navona, si impreziosisce con l’esposizione dedicata al pittore James Tissot (Nantes, 1836 – Buillon, 1902). Si tratta della prima grande mostra italiana su Tissot, una mostra che permetterà di scoprire un artista ancora non molto celebrato in Italia, ma già giustamente riscoperto e rivalutato in Francia, in Gran Bretagna, in America. Infatti delle 80 opere in mostra alcune provengono proprio dalla Tate di Londra, dal Musée d’Orsay, da importanti collezioni private americane. Pittore della moda e dell’eleganza, della bellezza e dell’amore, narratore della vita alto-borghese e della mondanità; poi pittore mistico e spirituale. Tissot è tutto questo, perfettamente in equilibrio tra influenze impressioniste e istanze preraffaellite, in un mix che seppe dargli in vita un enorme successo. Il suo nome Jacques Joseph naturalizzato in James già racconta dei suoi viaggi, del suo trasferimento da Parigi a Londra e delle influenze che la sua arte subì. Al Chiostro del Bramante i visitatori potranno conoscere la vita luccicante delle élites francesi ed inglesi di fine Ottocento; potranno ammirare le scene mondane dell’alta borghesia, immersi in atmosfere raffinate; potranno toccare con mano la ricchezza e la bellezza di abiti, accessori e oggetti d’arredamento delle classi sociali più agiate. L’arte di Tissot ha sempre riscosso grandi consensi per la sua modernità, per le scelte tematiche e per lo stile assolutamente dettagliato: preciso e particolareggiato in ogni minuzia, il pittore realizzava ritratti che sembrano fotografie. Altrettanto esaltante è il suo talento da colorista con cui l’artista sapeva far brillare ogni dettaglio delle proprie opere. In mostra a Roma sono documentate le diverse fasi della vita e della produzione pittorica di James Tissot, con le sue passioni e i suoi tormenti. Dalla pittura storica degli esordi parigini alle scene mondane dei salotti francesi ed inglesi, dalla passione per la moda all’amore per Kathleen Newton, amante, soggetto di molte opere e causa della più grande sofferenza di Tissot e della sua crisi mistica con conseguente svolta artistica. Kathleen Newton era una giovane donna irlandese, divorziata dal marito Ufficiale dell’Esercito Inglese ed esclusa dalla buona società vittoriana. Tissot se ne innamorò, la accolse nella propria casa e la rese modella di molti suoi quadri: in mostra la si ammira in tante vesti, misteriosa, malinconica, orgogliosa, fragile. Malata di tisi, Kathleen si suicidò giovanissima e da questa perdita Tissot non si riprese mai più. Da qui derivò la sua conversione al cattolicesimo e la svolta artistica che lo portò a dipingere le scene del figliol prodigo, anch’esse ben documentate in mostra.\n",

      "La conosciamo per la sua musica e la partecipazione ad Amici, che l'ha definitivamente lanciata nel mondo dello spettacolo italiano, esaltando il suo talento. Annalisa Scarrone, dopo diverse partecipazioni al festival di Sanremo ed un nome divenuto sempre più pesante nel mondo della musica, si appresta a fare il suo ingresso nel mondo del cinema dalla porta principale, con una commedia per il prossimo Natale diretta da Maurizio Casagrande, storica spalla teatrale e cinematografica di Vincenzo Salemme e con Mariagrazia Cucinotta nel cast. Il film di si chiamerà \"Babbo Natale non viene da nord\" e nella pellicola Annalisa intepreterà due ruoli, due facce di una stessa medaglia, ovvero una cantante di successo e sicura di sé, chiamata proprio Annalisa. L'altra, Inda, con le stesse aspirazioni ma un'indole completamente diversa, timida e insicura. In un'intervista riportata all'Ansa lei esalta la dicotomia e la completezza di questi due personaggi: Uno dei ruoli che interpreto sono io, Annalisa la cantante. L'altra, India, in realtà mi somiglia molto. Sono i due lati opposti che molte persone dello spettacolo hanno: quello che si vede e quello che non si vede. India arricchisce la concezione che il pubblico ha di me, mostrando il mio lato buffo, impacciato, a volte anche paranoico e pieno di incertezze, ma altrettanto importante, perché quando sei troppo sicuro è meglio che cambi lavoro Quando le si chiede che aspettative abbia rispetto ad un'ipotetica carriera da attrice, lei non alza il tiro, ma non nega che le piacerebbe molto, nonostante continui a credere che nel suo destino non possa esserci altro che la musica: \"Una carriera da attrice? Magari… La musica però resta il mio destino. Il discrimine era per quanta parte della mia vita ci sarei riuscita\". Infine non si poteva non fare menzione ad Amici, la trasmissione che le ha cambiato la vita, e alla possibilità di essere una delle coach della trasmissione nel prossimo anno:\n",

      "Veronica Burchielli annuncia via Instagram la rottura con Alessandro Zarino. In un post, l’ex corteggiatrice di Uomini e Donne ha fatto sapere che la relazione con il tronista è finita a distanza da qualche mese dall’inizio. “Ciao ragazzi come state? Spero tutto bene. Sono stata molto assente, ho avuto bisogno di tempo per pensare e vivermi delle emozioni. Io non riesco a fingere che tutto vada bene e non riesco a mostrarmi spensierata ed allegra se in realtà non sto bene. Io non riesco a non essere sincera. Ho bisogno di raccontarvi delle cose” ha esordito Veronica, per poi ufficializzare la rottura. Veronica annuncia di avere voluto rendere pubblica la rottura per rispetto delle persone che hanno seguito il suo percorso a Uomini e Donne, sostenendola durante il no al tronista e successivamente, quando ah fatto marcia indietro decidendo di abbandonare la trasmissione insieme a Zarino: Ad alcuni di voi non interesserà forse, ma per rispetto a tutte quelle persone che hanno creduto in noi…io credo sia giusto che voi sappiate. Forse non sono tenuta a farlo ma io sento di dovervelo. E non perché sono “personaggio”, non mi ci sento affatto, ma per gratitudine a tutte quelle persone che dedicano anche 5 minuti del loro tempo per me. Io che sono una sconosciuta, per scrivermi un messaggio bello o brutto che sia. Per gratitudine a quelle persone che si sono appassionate alla coppia e hanno creduto in noi, dedicandoci il loro tempo, le loro parole. Siamo nati come coppia pubblica quindi è giusto che voi sappiate. Se fino ad oggi non ho detto niente è perché questo non è il momento più adatto, più giusto, con quello che sta succede e due perché non c’era niente di certo. Veronica non ha voluto rendere noti i motivi della separazione da Alessandro, preferendo restassero privati: “Fino a che non è stata presa una decisione ho sempre preferito dire che tutto andava bene per tutelarci. Non dando la possibilità ad eventi o fattori esterni di appesantire il nostro momento, evitando inutili gossip su interviste o giornalini o pagine perché è normale avere delle difficoltà in un rapporto. Ci saranno sempre ma ciò non significa mettere in discussione la coppia”. Poi ha concluso:\n",

      "L'idea di una casa scavata nelle dune di Cape Cod, nel Massachusetts, USA, è venuta all'architetto Selim Vural, fondatore dello Studio Vural di base a Brooklyn, dopo una vacanza nella zona. L'analisi del terreno, del clima e della vegetazione di Cape Cod hanno dato vita alla Dune House, una casa scavata in una duna che più energia pulita di quella consumata grazie ad un attento studio della sua struttura e del modo di sfruttare al meglio il paesaggio circostante. La Dune House è una casa off grid che sfrutta la meglio la vista mozzafiato e le qualità del terreno. La casa basa la sua autosufficienza sulle temperature geotermiche della sabbia attraverso profonde pile di acciaio e ricoperta di terra su tutti i lati. Mr. Vural definisce la Dune House come \"la prossima generazione di case iper-sostenibili\" e spera che possa servire da esempio per le future costruzioni e come atteggiamento responsabile rispetto ai cambiamenti climatici. La casa è visibile solo a chi viene dal mare, mentre dalla terra ferma la casa sembra mimetizzarsi completamente nella duna di sabbia se non fosse per una spaccatura nel terreno che rappresenta l'ingresso stesso alla Dune House.\n",

Per quanto appaia assurdo, infatti, la notizia che circola in questi giorni riguardo al prossimo lancio di due importanti Apple-devices al di fuori del CES 2011, sta monopolizzando le chiacchiere intorno al megaevento di Las Vegas. Stando alle dichiarazioni di eminenti commentatori tecnologici quali AppleInsider e BusinessWeek, Mr. Jobs sarebbe ormai già pronto a sfornare non solo l'iPad 2, ma anche l'attesissimo Verizon iPhone, protagonista dei sogni proibiti di tutti gli Apple-maniaci statunitensi. Techcrunch ha paragonato l'attesa del nuovo melafonino a quella dell'arrivo dei Beatles su iTunes: tutti sanno che accadrà, tutti vogliono che accada, ma nessuno sa dire quando. Ebbene, ora il quando sembra essere arrivato, almeno in via orientativa, e tutto appare organizzato a puntino per rubare la scena agli eventi che si susseguiranno sul palcoscenico dell'International CES. Secondo i primi rumors, infatti, Apple presenterà i device nel corso del prossimo evento made in Cupertino \"Macworld\", secondo altri i dispositivi non saranno presentati in contemporanea, all'interno del medesimo evento, ma avranno presentazioni separate.\n",

      "“Spectre”, il 24esimo capitolo delle avventure di James Bond, ha già incassato più di 557 milioni di dollari. Daniel Craig, classe 1968, occhi azzurrissimi, fisico scultoreo e talento immenso, è alla sua quarta volta nei panni di 007, ma nella sua carriera ha girato circa 37 film, lavorando con alcuni dei più grandi registi in circolazione. Oltre ai 4 spettacolari film sull’agente segreto al servizio di sua maestà, ha preso parte a capolavori come “Munich”, “Era mio padre”, “L’amore fatale”, molto diversi tra loro, ma tutti stupendi. Se siete tra i suoi estimatori, qui di seguito, trovate 10 pellicole dell’attore che dovete assolutamente vedere. Lo straordinario film del 1998, diretto da John Maybury, è basato sulla vita del pittore irlandese Francis Bacon, interpretato da Derek Jacobi. Il regista si sofferma sulla lunga e drammatica relazione del pittore con il suo modello George Dyer (Daniel Craig), il quale, mentre il suo amante si trova ad una retrospettiva in suo onore al Gran Palais di Parigi, nel 1971, si suicida ingerendo una dose di barbiturici e alcol. Da quel momento, parte una sorta di lungo flashback che racconta la loro tormentata storia. La pellicola di Sam Mendes, del 2002, è ambientata nella Chicago degli anni ’30. Qui, Michael Sullivan (Tom Hanks) è un killer di una gang irlandese che fa capo al padrino John Rooney. Sullivan, però, è anche un padre e marito amorevole e buono e, una sera, suo figlio Michael Jr. assiste ad un’esecuzione messa in atto proprio da suo padre e da Connor (Daniel Craig), figlio di John Rooney. Temendo che il ragazzo possa raccontare tutto, Connor decide di eliminarlo, ma uccide il figlio più piccolo e la moglie di Mike. Da quel momento, Mike e il figlio dovranno scappare, mentre sulle loro tracce Connor sguinzaglierà il killer Maguire (Jude Law). Nel thriller di Matthew Vaughn, tratto dal romanzo “L’ultima partita” di J.J. Connolly, Daniel Craig è uno scaltro spacciatore che ha deciso di ritirarsi e godersi la vita. Il suo capo, però, gli affida un’ultima missione: trattare una partita di ecstasy con un boss di quartiere e ritrovare la figlia di un suo amico, scappata di casa con un drogato. La missione gli farà realizzare che, uscire dal giro, non sarà così facile come credeva. Nello straordinario film di Roger Michell, tratto dal romanzo omonimo di Ian McEwan, Daniel Craig è Joe, un uomo che, un giorno, mentre sta facendo un picnic con la fidanzata Claire (Samantha Morton),viene bruscamente interrotto dall'arrivo di un'enorme mongolfiera rossa, fuori controllo. Joe, assieme ad altre persone presenti al parco, cercano di aiutare l'uomo a tenere la mongolfiera a terra, ma invano. Così, gli uomini lasciano la presa dalla corda, e uno di loro perde la vita, precipitando al suolo. Turbato dall’evento, Joe viene avvicinato da Jed (Rhys Ifans), uno dei soccorritori. L’uomo inizierà a manifestare atteggiamenti strani, ossessivi e morbosi, sconvolgendo la vita di Joe. Il meraviglioso “Munich”, diretto da Steven Spielberg narra la terribile storia vera dell’uccisione degli atleti israeliani, durante le Olimpiadi del 1972, da parte degli estremisti palestinesi Settembre Nero. Dopo gli attentati, una squadra di cinque uomini viene assoldata per eliminare 11 alti esponenti del terrorismo palestinese. Tra quei cinque uomini ci sono Eric Bana e Daniel Craig, rispettivamente nei panni di Avner Kaufmann e Steve. il 21esimo capitolo della saga di 007, e il primo con Daniel Craig, è diretto da Martin Campbell e parte dalla promozione di Bond a “doppio 0”, dopo che l’agente ha ucciso due traditori dell’M16 a Praga. Successivamente, Bond si mette sulle tracce di alcuni finanzieri che riciclano il denaro sporco proveniente dalle casse dei dittatori di tutto il mondo. Le ricerche lo portano alle Bahamas, poi in Montenegro, dove parteciperà ad una partita a poker al Casino Royale. Il suo obiettivo è battere Le Chiffre (Mads Mikkelsen), uno dei banchieri implicati in quelle azioni criminali. Craig fece subito centro nel cuore dei fan di 007, portando a casa ben 599 milioni di dollari e garantendosi il posto per altri capitoli. Il film fantasy di Chris Weitz, adattamento cinematografico del romanzo di Philip Pullman, racconta la storia di Lyra, un'orfana che vive in un college di Oxford. La bambina ha al suo fianco un “daimon”, la propria anima in forma animale. Lyra viene in possesso di un aletiometro, simile ad una bussola d'oro, in grado di rispondere a qualsiasi domanda. Il Magisterium, l'organismo governativo globale capeggiato da Marisa Coulter (Nicole Kidman), vuole assoggettare sempre di più il popolo, così fa rapire i bambini dai misteriosi Ingoiatori, che li portano qualche parte nel Nord per sottoporli ad esperimenti. Quando, però, scompare anche Roger, il miglior amico di Lyra, la ragazzina decide di andare a cercarlo e ad aiutarla ci saranno: il ricco zio e scienziato Lord Asriel (Daniel Craig), la strega Serafina Pekkala (Eva Green), un avventuriero texano Lee Scoresby (Sam Elliott), e Iorek Byrnison, un orso polare corazzato.\n",

      "Come spesso accade, Fortnite ha smesso di funzionare questa mattina. Il motivo? L'aggiornamento 18.10, su cui sta lavorando Epic Games in questo momento per implementarlo al gioco. A differenza però degli update tipici di stagione, quest'ultimo risulta essere più pesante di dimensioni, specie su Xbox Series X|S e Nintendo Switch. Secondo gli indizi trapelati grazie a insider e leak, l'aggiornamento 18.10 anticiperà i festeggiamenti di Halloween e porterà con sé una serie di contenuti a tema, tra skin e oggetti. Ad ogni modo, basta attendere il solito paio d'ore prima che il team di sviluppo pubblichi le note ufficiali sul blog ufficiale per scoprire il tutto. Dopo di che sarà possibile riavviare Fortnite e toccare con mano le novità portate dal primo aggiornamento della Stagione 8 del Capitolo 2. Tale Stagione prende il nome di Al Cubo, perché vede il ritorno di uno storico personaggio dell'ecosistema Fortnite, vale a dire il malvagio Kevin il Cubo. Dopo l'invasione aliena della Stagione 7, l'isola di gioco adesso appare oscura, dominata da creature mostruose e senzienti. Del resto, l'esercito di cubi non sta solo diffondendo la contaminazione, ma sta spargendo dei portali per il ViceVerso. Questo il concept dell'ottava stagione di Fortnite, che si appresta ad accogliere importanti contenuti: non solo il corposo aggiornamento 18.10, ma anche crossover inediti. Gli ultimi rumor legati al battle-royale di Epic Games parlano infatti di un prossimo arrivo di Naruto, il celebre ninja creato dal mangaka Masashi Kishimoto. Se tutto ciò dovesse rivelarsi vero – e ci sono buone probabilità che lo sia – sarebbe il primo crossover tratto dalla cultura pop giapponese.\n",

      "Selezionava i bambini più fragili e vulnerabili e li offriva all'attenzione dei preti pedofili. Un nuovo scandalo a sfondo sessuale sta travolgendo la chiesa cattolica in Argentina. Al centro della vicenda, c'è ancora una volta l'Istituto Provolo di Mendoza, nella zona centro-occidentale del paese sud americano, già in passato alla ribalta delle cronache mondiali per presunti abusi sessuali su minori sordomuti da parte dei preti. Questa volta a finire in manette è una suora di origine orientale, Kosaka Kumiko, 42 anni e ribattezzata dalla stampa locale \"la monaca degli abusi\". La donna è stata arrestata dopo un mese di latitanza con l'accusa di aver favoreggiato per anni le violenze sessuali dei sacerdoti lì presenti nei confronti dei ragazzi ospiti della struttura. La donna, trasferita nel carcere di Mendoza indossando ancora l'abito monacale, è stata denunciata da alcune vittime. Interrogata in tribunale, ha dichiarato di essere non colpevole e di non sapere nulla degli abusi consumatisi all'interno dell'Istituto che gli inquirenti stanno analizzando. \"Sono una brava persona, che ha donato la sua vita a Dio\", avrebbe dichiarato la sorella. Kosaka Kumiko è arrivata a Mendoza nel 2007 dal Giappone e ha lavorato al Provolo per ben sei anni. I giovani che l'accusano, supportati dalla Ong Xumek, hanno dichiarato che la suora svolgeva un ruolo centrale nella vicenda, selezionando i bambini più \"sottomessi\" e vulnerabili per consegnarli ai sacerdoti come prede. Una ragazza sostiene addirittura che le abbia fatto indossare un pannolino, quando aveva cinque anni, per nascondere l'emorragia provocata dai sistematici stupri a cui diversi preti l'avevano sottoposta.\n",

      "È già arrivata al capolinea, la relazione tra Federica Benincà e Marco Cartasegna. I due si erano conosciuti nello studio di ‘Uomini e Donne‘. Il 3 maggio, il tronista aveva scelto di iniziare una frequentazione con la Benincà, preferendola alle altre corteggiatrici. A poco più di un mese dalla scelta, i due hanno deciso di prendere strade diverse. A comunicarlo è stata Federica, tramite un lungo post su Instagram. Le sue parole sono state: \"The eyes never lie\". Perché alla fine sta tutto negli occhi. E i nostri non hanno mai mentito, soprattutto oggi. Due mesi fa, dissi a Marco: \"Vedremo i nostri pregi e i nostri difetti e se saremo fortunati li sceglieremo entrambi\". Ci siamo scelti, con tante aspettative e tanta voglia di viverci, ma dopo tutto, non siamo stati così fortunati. Perché a volte i sentimenti non bastano, subentrano tanti altri fattori sia esterni che interni alla coppia. Due persone passionali come noi, sono passionali sempre, nel bene e nel male. E certamente la lontananza, lo studio per me (con annessa vita universitaria) e il lavoro per Marco, non ci hanno aiutato. Resta il fatto che prima di essere una coppia che si lascia, siamo Federica e Marco che si sono scelti e non rinneghiamo neanche per un secondo tutto quello che c'è stato tra di noi, anzi. Le parole ora sono superflue. Federica Benincà, dunque, ha concluso: Ci siamo salutati abbracciandoci, con una promessa \"Lasciamo fare al destino\". Non saprei cosa dire oltre, ma concludo con una citazione: “Quando si smette di amare, in genere non si ha la pazienza di aspettare che finisca bene. Si cerca la strada più breve: la rottura, la sofferenza. Invece ci vuole lo stesso impegno e la stessa intensità dell'inizio, bisogna superare gli egoismi, vivere questo momento con la stessa passione, far sentire alla persona lasciata tutto il bene che c'è stato: ci vuole amore per chiudere una storia.” Ed io sono FIERA della persona che ho avuto al mio fianco, anche se ora non sarà più come prima. E ripeto: non aver avuto il nostro lieto fine, non sminuisce la storia che c'è stata. Grazie di tutto\". Marco ha pubblicato la sua replica nei commenti al post di Federica:\n",

      "L'animatissima querelle \"Gabriele Muccino contro il web\" è stato l'evento social degli ultimi giorni. In corrispondenza del quarantennale della morte di Pier Paolo Pasolini, nel bel mezzo delle celebrazioni in memoria del grande cineasta e intellettuale, una dichiarazione social del regista di \"L'ultimo bacio\" ha infatti sollevato un polverone senza precedenti: Pasolini era un \"non regista\", che usava la macchina da presa in modo amatoriale, senza stile, senza un punto di vista meramente cinematografico. Il profilo Facebook è stato così investito da una valanga di critiche e insulti. La sua bacheca è stata invasa da un numero così alto di commenti che la pagina è stata improvvisamente chiusa (secondo lui, causa segnalazioni di alcuni utenti). Una volta tornato attivo, Muccino ha voluto mettere definitivamente il punto sull'argomento, ripartendo da toni molto più moderati con cui ha spiegato come il suo giudizio su Pasolini non fosse stato scritto di getto, ma basato sulla sua esperienza di fruitore e appassionato di cinema: Ieri mi sono rivisto La Ricotta. Perdonatemi per aver pensato per un momento che il mio post su Pasolini fosse stato scritto troppo istintivamente o distrattamente. Che fosse superficiale, ingenuo o altro. La mia opinione su un Maestro immenso come Pasolini, tessitore di sceneggiature, di poesie, di provocazioni, del mettersi a nudo nella pubblica piazza conscio delle pietre che gli avrebbero (e hanno) scagliato contro, grande scrittore e persino raffinato, acuto giornalista (e la lista va avanti perché, insomma, ha fatto proprio tanto Pier Paolo Pasolini), non è cambiata dopo la visione de la Ricotta, mescolata a ricordi di altri suoi film da regista, da Accattone a Salò. Il fatto è che ognuno di noi, quando è giovane e sceglie autonomamente il proprio viaggio, sceglie come punti di riferimento certi Maestri, coloro a cui vorremmo assomigliare. Ebbene, a distanza di anni da quando vidi La Ricotta per la prima volta, ho sempre perseguito un tipo di cinema e di stile lontanissimo da ciò che Pasolini realizzava e avrebbe realizzato. Ero alla ricerca del mio stile dove poter infilare le intuizioni, le idee di ognuno dei Maestri che sapevo di non poter mai eguagliare. Muccino non riserva ulteriori parole a chi l'ha criticato, non torna a rispondere ai suoi hater che ha definito \"parentesi penosa di fascismo applicato\", ma si limita a raccontare quali sono i suoi punti di riferimento nell'universo cinematografico italiano e internazionale: Adoro Bertolucci ma non tanto Godard, Bazin e la nouvelle Vague. Ma il mio amore per Bertolucci è comunque assoluto e a lui l'ho detto e dichiarato decine di volte. Adoro Tarantino ma detesto i B movies italiani a cui lui si ispira. Discussi animatamente con lui perché nel 2007 non aveva ancora mai visto Ladri di Biciclette o Umberto D. Adoro Vittorio De Sica. Lo ripeto da anni e lo imito appena posso, come posso. Adoro incondizionatamente le opere di Fellini fino ad alcune che non ho capito, per mia miopia sicuramente, come il Satyricon. Questo per dire che ognuno decide i propri punti di riferimento, ciò che vuole siano le proprie coordinate e il tragitto che vuole compiere nella propria auspicabile carriera. Poi il destino fa la sua parte comunque, lo sappiamo. Io sapevo quali fossero le mie coordinate di viaggio e le ho seguite. Il \"mio\" cinema era per me altrove: era Woody Allen, Kubrick, Bob Fosse, Chaplin, Buster Keaton, Griffith, Cassavetes, Scorsese, Petri, Visconti, Bertolucci, Germi, Rossellini, Scola, Leone, Altman, Stone… me e il fanciullino che voleva germogliare per dire la sua.\n",

I problemi di Kendall con l'acne sono iniziati molto presto, come lei stessa ha raccontato più volte, ma si sono aggravati verso i 14 anni: \"Ricordo che l'estate prima del liceo la mia pelle è impazzita\" – dice, mentre usa i prodotti di make up della linea della sorella, Kylie Cosmetics.

      "Alena Seredova regala ai suoi fan splendidi momenti di tenerezza insieme alla figlia Vivienne Charlotte, 1 anno. La showgirl di origine ceca ha pubblicato alcuni scatti meravigliosi che la mostrano insieme alla bambina, nata dall'amore con il compagno Alessandro Nasi. Il post (in basso) ha fatto ovviamente il pieno di like perché la biondissima bimba è semplicemente stupenda. Era il 19 maggio del 2020 quando Alena Seredova e Nasi salutavano l'arrivo di Vivienne Charlotte nella loro vita. Alena ha avuto la sua terza figlia a 41 anni, dopo 5 di relazione con il dirigente torinese legato sia per parentela che per questioni lavorative con la famiglia Agnelli. \"Alla mia età ho deciso di tuffarmi in questa nuova avventura perché, dall’ultimo figlio, sono passati dieci anni e non mi ricordo più niente\", aveva detto la Seredova a Vieni da me. Ancora una volta ha scelto un nome esterofilo: i primi due figli, avuti dal matrimonio finito con Gianluigi Buffon, si chiamano Louis Thomas e David Lee, nati rispettivamente nel 2007 e nel 2009. Vivienne significa \"vitale, che ha vita\" (dal latino \"vivus\") e Charlotte è la versione femminile di Charles/Carlo, che significa \"uomo libero\". La Seredova sta trascorrendo le sue vacanze in una delle mete più gettonate dai vip: la classicissima Forte dei Marmi (Lucca), peraltro storica location di villeggiatura per la dinastia Agnelli. In questo periodo di pandemia in cui anche i personaggi famosi preferiscono trascorrere le vacanze in Italia ed evitare le mete esotiche, sono tanti coloro che hanno trascorso un periodo nella lussuosa località toscana. Tra loro, Chiara Ferragni e Fedez con i figli Leone e Vittoria, Giulia Salemi e Pierpaolo Pretelli, Federica Panicucci e Marco Bacini.\n",

      "Il nonno materno di Eitan, il bimbo sopravvissuto alla tragedia del Mottarone, è finito agli arresti domiciliari in Israele. Il provvedimento, stando a quanto riportato dall'agenzia di stampa Ansa, è previsto fino a venerdì. Shmuel Peleg, accusato di sequestro di persona aggravato dopo che ha portato il bambino con un volo privato dalla Svizzera in Israele, è stato interrogato dall'unità speciale 433. Al momento però non sembrerebbe che la decisione delle autorità israeliane sia legata a un mandato d'arresto emesso dall'Italia. Sulla vicenda si è espresso anche l'avvocato Paolo Sevesi che ha detto: \"A me risulta che gli sia stato chiesto di restare a disposizione della polizia\". Sabato scorso il 58enne era andato a trovare il nipote che, da quando è stato dimesso dall'ospedale, è stato affidato – secondo quanto stabilito dalla Procura di Pavia – alle cure degli zii paterni. La famiglia materna poteva andare a trovare il piccolo Eitan. Durante l'orario di visita, il nonno lo ha portato fuori dall'abitazione: entrambi si sono recati in Svizzera dove ad attenderli c'era un aereo privato che li ha riportati in Israele. Sono quindi scattate immediatamente le indagini. Oltre a Peleg, anche l'ex moglie è indagata per la stessa accusa. Per gli inquirenti avrebbe contribuito a organizzare la fuga in Italia. Fin da subito i nonni materni si sono difesi affermando di aver preso questa decisione a causa delle condizioni di salute del piccolo: \"Erano pessime e finalmente, dopo quattro mesi, i medici vedranno cos'è successo al piccolo\". Hanno inoltre spiegato che il bambino volesse da tempo tornare in Israele. Lo stesso legale che difende la famiglia materna ha sostenuto, durante un'intervista, che la scelta di dove vivere dovrebbe essere presa proprio da Eitan. Una posizione non condivisa dagli avvocati degli zii paterni che a Fanpage.it hanno detto: \"Non c'è nessun appiglio in diritto. È fantasia\".\n",

La madre, Gabriella, è tornata a parlare di lui, dalle pagine della rivista \"Chi\". La donna ha parlato di come Corona, stia vivendo le sue giornate in carcere. Sembra che, con il tempo, sia riuscito ad ambientarsi e ad andare d'accordo con chi condivide la cella con lui. \"Sta abbastanza bene, si è un po' ambientato. È tranquillo, ha un buon rapporto con il compagno di cella e gli altri detenuti, e si tiene molto occupato\" Ancora, però, non è riuscito a vedere il piccolo Carlos. Gabriella, spiega, che sono necessari degli accordi tra gli avvocati di Corona e quelli di Nina Moric. \"Non ha ancora visto Carlos. Ci sono tutti i permessi, ma gli avvocati di Nina e Fabrizio devono accordarsi su tempi e modalità, per esempio, su chi debba accompagnare il bambino\" La notizia del momento, riguarda la sua ex fidanzata, Belen Rodriguez. Negli ultimi mesi si parla molto del matrimonio, che avverrà nei prossimi giorni. A tal proposito, però, Corona sembra essere del tutto disinteressato. \"Non ha mai parlato di Belen, ci sono cose ben più importanti. Ciò non toglie che io non ho niente contro di lei. Ho anche conosciuto Stefano De Martino e il loro figlio. Ed è stato un incontro molto affettuoso\" Fabrizio Corona, ovviamente, non è tipo da starsene con le mani in mano. Anche nel carcere si tiene in forma e, soprattutto, si occupa di nuovi progetti. A quanto dichiarato da mamma Gabriella, Fabrizio sarebbe impegnato nella scrittura di un libro che ripercorre la sua vicenda.\n",

      "Era il 2008 quando i Coldplay pubblicarono l'album \" Viva la vida or Death and All His Friends\", quarto album in studio della band capitanata da Chris Martin e diventato negli anni uno dei gruppi più amati al mondo, in grado di riempire stadi e sfornare successi su successi. Partiti nel 2000 con \"Parachutes\" che conteneva singoli come \"Yellow\" e \"Trouble\", la carriera della band proseguì nel 2002 con \"A Rush of Blood to the Head\", che conteneva canzoni come \"In my place\" e \"The Scientist\" e, nel 2005, da \"X&Y\" (tra i singoli \"Fix You\" e \"Speed of Sound\"), i Coldplay arrivarono, nel 2008, a Viva la vida quando la loro stella era già splendente nel panorama del pop mondiale, con la musica che si accompagnava anche alla storia d'amore che coinvolgeva il leader Martin e l'attrice hollywoodiana Gwyneth Paltrow. Insomma, tutti i tasselli erano a posto per sfornare l'ennesimo successo. \"Viva la vida\" fu il secondo singolo estratto dall'album e il successo fu immediato, il pubblico e la critica amarono fin subito la canzone, spingendo al pezzo ad aggiudicarsi due premi ai Grammy Awards 2009, nelle categorie \"Canzone dell'anno\" e \"Miglior interpretazione vocale di gruppo\", non riuscendo a spingere l'album verso quello di migliore dell'anno (vinse nella categoria \"Miglior album rock\"). In Italia il singolo arrivò fino al secondo posto, mentre l'album si arrampicò fino al primo posto della classifica FIMI, restandoci due settimane, prima di essere scalzato da \"Non ti scordar mai di me\" di Giusy Ferreri. \"Viva la vida\" resta anche uno dei must in scaletta, compresa quella che stanno portando in giro nel loro tour europeo che tocca l'Italia il 3 e 4 luglio per il doppio concerto allo stadio San Siro. Un pezzo tra i più amati e anche i più \"interpretati\" della loro storia. Il nome della canzone, come ormai noto, si ispira a un celebre quadro di Frida Kahlo, pittrice messicana, amato da Martin per il suo incredibile ottimismo: \"Viva la vida\", in fondo, non è che la traduzione spagnola di \"Viva la vita\". La canzone parla di Re, Cavalieri e missionari con continui riferimenti biblici (come il verso \"I know Saint Peter won't call my name\" o \"Revolutionaries wait, For my head on a silver plate\" che potrebbe riferirsi alla decapitazione di San Giovanni), e in molti, cercandone l'esegesi precisa, hanno visto riferimenti alla Rivoluzione francese anche se la band non li ha mai confermati. In un'intervista a Q Magazine, citata da SongFacts e Wikipedia, il bassista Guy Berryman ha detto: \"È la storia di un re che perde il suo regno e tutto l'artwork dell'album è basato sull'idea di rivoluzionari e della guerriglia. C'è questo leggero punto di vista antiautoritario che striscia tra le parole ed è un po' il risultato dell'essere circondati dai Governi da un lato, ma anche dal fatto che siamo esseri umani con delle emozioni e sul fatto moriremo tutti e sulla stupidità di tutto quello che bisogna sopportare ogni giorno. Da qui il titolo dell'album\".\n",

      "Lil Nas X, il cantante che con \"Old Town Road\" ha infranto numerosi record nelle classifiche Usa è tornato da qualche giorno con il suo primo album \"Montero\" che sta ottenendo ottimi riscontri sia di critica che di pubblico, dopo che già con i singoli aveva tenuta alta l'attenzione. \"Old Town Road\" che ebbe enorme successo anche nel remix con Billy Ray Cyrus, però, fu croce e delizia, perché da una parte lo ha reso popolare in tutto il mondo, dopo aver fatto breccia su TikTok, ma, al contempo, ha rischiato anche di farlo diventare la classica One Hit Wonder, ovvero un artista ricordato solo per un'unica canzone e riportato continuamente a quella. Insomma intrappolato in un unico successo. Eppure è bastata l'uscita dell'album per capire che il rapper se l'è giocata bene, sia per quanto riguarda l'immagine data e rispecchiata nei testi di \"Montero\" sia nella musica. Ed è stato lui stesso a voler mettere le cose in chiaro, togliendosi qualche sassolino dalla scarpa direttamente con alcuni messaggi su Twitter. Il primo non propriamente delicato diceva: \"Andiamo! Grazie ai miei fan e ai miei hater dico ‘succhiatemi il ca**o'\" a commento di un dato preciso, ovvero la prima volta del cantante con tre canzoni contemporaneamente nella top 10 dei singoli Usa e \"That's what I want\" che è la quinta canzone a finire in top 10 per lui. Tre canzoni nella top 10 dei singoli Usa, con Montero che ha esordito in seconda posizione nella classifica degli album alle spalle solo di \"Certified Lover Boy\" di Drake alla terza settimana consecutiva in testa. Sono circa 126 mile gli equivalenti dell'album venduti, a cui si aggiungono le undici canzoni in top 100 e il totale di 60 milioni di ascoltatori mensili che ne fanno l'ottavo cantante più ascoltato al mondo: \"Wow, sono appena diventata la prima One hit wonder di tutti i tempi ad avere 11 canzoni in classifica tutte in una volta\".\n",

      "\"Entro la fine di agosto ci saranno almeno tre perturbazioni di origine atlantica che arriveranno sull'Italia, ma niente paura perché l'estate non è ancora finita. Tra il 2 il 3 settembre tornerà infatti l'anticiclone africano che porterà soprattutto al Sud una nuova, seppur breve, ondata di caldo\". Sono queste le previsioni del colonnello Mario Giuliacci, meteorologo e direttore operativo di meteogiuliacci.it, che a Fanpage.it ha spiegato quali sono le tendenze meteorologiche dei prossimi giorni e fino a quando durerà l'estate 2021 prima di salutare caldo e sole. Attenzione, però, a non definire il maltempo che si verificherà nei prossimi giorni \"la burrasca di Ferragosto\". Ecco perché. Secondo le tendenze del colonnello Giuliacci, tra oggi e il prossimo 31 agosto arriveranno in Italia tre perturbazioni di origine atlantica, che porteranno rovesci prima sulle regioni centro-settentrionali e poi via via anche al Sud, ma anche un sensibile calo delle temperature. \"Oggi, dopo il maltempo che pure ieri ha colpito gran parte del Nord del Paese – ha spiegato – ci saranno rovesci su gran parte delle regioni centrali, in particolare su Abruzzo, Molise, Lazio ed anche al Sud ad eccezione della Calabria e delle isole maggiori. Venerdì 27 la pioggia si estenderà al Sud e di nuovo sul Nord Est, complice l'arrivo della seconda perturbazione atlantica. Domenica ci saranno temporali diffusi ad eccezione che sulle isole. Infine, martedì 31 agosto con l'arrivo della terza perturbazione avremo ancora temporali su tutto il Nord, tranne che sull'Emilia Romagna, e sulla Toscana. Fino a domenica ci sarà una tregua dal caldo\".\n",

      "Tutta la serie dei Ghostbusters è pian piano diventata un cult in tutto il mondo, dai cartoni ai film in cui Bill Murray era personaggio attivo e protagonista affiancato dalla spesso diabolica Sigourney Weaver. Noto per non essere esattamente un pozzo di simpatia nella vita, risulta invece oltre che un ottimo caratterista, un attore con fiuto per i capolavori indipendenti. In Ed Wood di Burton era un ambiguo travestito con la passione per le tragedie, in Broken Flowers di Jarmusch un uomo in cerca di una famiglia e affetto incondizionato, in Lost in Translation di Sofia Coppola cercava il suo equilibrio, trovando una Scarlett Johansson meno diva e per questo più convincente che mai. Era solo questione di tempo prima che a qualche regista venisse l'idea di aggiungere un terzo film alla saga degli acchiappafantasmi, Murray ha deciso recentemente di partecipare apportando qualche modifica alla sceneggiatura, per stupire e gestire la parte in modo originale. Da un intervista dell'attore si percepisce che il ruolo in Ghostbusters sarà perlopiù quello di un fantasma.Murray ha preteso di venire ucciso all'inizio del film per partecipare come spirito e non come cacciatore in carne e ossa. Il regista sarà sempre Ivan Reitman, già produttore di Chloe in uscita a fine marzo. Gli impegni non si fermano qui per il vulcano Bill Murray che ha in cantiere un noir-indie, così viene presentato Passion Play le cui riprese sono in corso in Nuovo Messico. La pellicola, scritta e diretta da Mitch Glazer (La regola del sospetto, Paradiso Perduto) racconta la storia di un suonatore di tromba caduto in disgrazia (Mickey Rourke) e di un angelo anni cinquanta (Megan Fox) perseguitato dalla mafia.\n",

      "Sex and the City è uno dei telefilm più amati da noi donne per la sua capacità di descrivere in modo spontaneo il nostro mondo. L’amore e il sesso vengono raccontati senza pudore e le quattro protagoniste non hanno paura di affrontare le loro paure, i loro sentimenti e i loro desideri erotici. Carrie è l’inguaribile romantica del gruppo, quella, che nonostante le mille delusioni, crede ancora nell’amore capace di vincere ogni cosa. Samantha è disinibita, indipendente e realizzata, mostra che anche una donna, solo con la sua forza, può essere capace di sottomettere un uomo senza neppure sforzarsi troppo. Miranda nasconde un cuore aperto all’amore dietro la sua apparenza seria e cattiva, mentre Charlotte è l’eterna sognatrice, solo a primo impatto un po’ bigotta, ma capace di affrontare le sue avventure sessuali con la stessa disinibizione delle altre. Il telefilm Sex and the City ha segnato le nostre vite e ci ha insegnato molto su come affrontare nel modo giusto il mondo dell’amore e del sesso. 1. \"Forse tutti gli uomini sono una droga: a volte ti fanno deprimere e a volte, come adesso, ti fanno sballare\" – Noi donne siamo quasi ossessionate dalla ricerca dell’amore e dell’uomo giusto, tanto che conoscere ed uscire con nuove persone può diventare quasi una droga. L’importante è sapere cosa si cerca, in modo da aspettarsi già quali saranno gli effetti di quella “droga”. 2. \"Non posso farmi condizionare dalle regole, io seguo le mie emozioni\" – Carrie ci ha insegnato che bisogna seguire sempre il proprio cuore e che non si possono ignorare i sentimenti. Quando ci troveremo davanti l’uomo della nostra vita, non ne potremo fare a meno, anche se ci ha trattate male, anche se si tratta del più grande donnaiolo della storia. 3. \"Si può fare dell'ottimo sesso con chi non ti piace, non rispetti o non ricordi nemmeno\" – Samantha è indubbiamente la regina del sesso occasionale, senza sentimenti e senza neppure interesse. Il desiderio sessuale è un bisogno biologico: chi dice che noi donne non possiamo farlo con il primo che capita? 4. \"Credo proprio che non si possa evitare di farlo in tre perché chi c'è stato prima di te non se ne va mai\" – Il passato è un fardello pesante che tutte ci portiamo dietro. Ci sarà sempre un ex importante e ci tornerà sempre alla mente un vecchio ricordo mentre siamo con un altro, è inevitabile. 5. \"Conosciamo davvero le persone con cui andiamo a letto?\" – Probabilmente a volte siamo così affascinate dall’apparenza di un uomo, da non preoccuparci di conoscerlo più a fondo. Non sappiamo aspettare, siamo ansiose di arrivare al momento clou e non c’è nulla che potrebbe fermarci. 6. \"C'è un momento in ogni rapporto in cui il romanticismo lascia il posto alla realtà\" – Le donne amano essere delle inguaribili romantiche e forse è proprio a causa dei nostri sogni troppo ambiziosi che spesso rimaniamo deluse dalla realtà. Non viviamo in un film, a volte anche un rapporto può dimostrarsi squallido e misero. 7. \"Per dimenticare ci vuole almeno la metà del tempo che si è stati insieme: è la regola del lasciarsi\" – In amore di solito non esistono regole, anche se Charlotte non la pensa così. Se ci pensiamo però, è più tormentata e triste la fine di un rapporto particolarmente lungo, piuttosto che la rottura di una storia breve e poco seria.\n",

      "Una minorenne decide di abortire, Trattandosi di minore deve esserci l'assenso di coloro che esercitano la potesta (i genitori) o è necessario l'assenso di colui che esercità la tutela (quando mancano o genitori). Se i genitori o il tutore non vogliono dare il loro assenso (o in caso di estrema necessità ed urgenza) è prevista l'autorizzazione del Giudice Tutelare in base all' art. 12 legge n. 194 del 22 maggio 1978, il quale dispone che \"La richiesta di interruzione della gravidanza secondo le procedure della presente legge è fatta personalmente dalla donna. Se la donna è di età inferiore ai diciotto anni, per l'interruzione della gravidanza è richiesto lo assenso di chi esercita sulla donna stessa la potestà o la tutela. Tuttavia, nei primi novanta giorni, quando vi siano seri motivi che impediscano o sconsiglino la consultazione delle persone esercenti la potestà o la tutela, oppure queste, interpellate, rifiutino il loro assenso o esprimano pareri tra loro difformi, il consultorio o la struttura socio-sanitaria, o il medico di fiducia, rimette entro sette giorni dalla richiesta una relazione, corredata del proprio parere, al giudice tutelare del luogo in cui esso opera. Il giudice tutelare, entro cinque giorni, sentita la donna e tenuto conto della sua volontà, delle ragioni che adduce e della relazione trasmessagli, può autorizzare la donna, con atto non soggetto a reclamo, a decidere la interruzione della gravidanza. Qualora il medico accerti l'urgenza dell'intervento a causa di un grave pericolo per la salute della minore di diciotto anni, indipendentemente dall'assenso di chi esercita la potestà o la tutela e senza adire il giudice tutelare, certifica l'esistenza delle condizioni che giustificano l'interruzione della gravidanza. Tale certificazione costituisce titolo per ottenere in via d'urgenza l'intervento e, se necessario, il ricovero. Ai fini dell'interruzione della gravidanza dopo i primi novanta giorni, si applicano anche alla minore di diciotto anni le procedure di cui all'articolo 7, indipendentemente dall'assenso di chi esercita la potestà o la tutela\". La decisione della Corte Costituzionale è importante perchè partendo da una particolare questione concreta (una donna minorenne) codifica i poteri del Giudice tutelare, infatti, leggendo la normativa è legittimo interrogarsi su quale è il reale ruolo del Giudice tutelare? Quest'ultimo può spingersi fino al punto da sostituire la volontà della donna e impedire la procedura medica? La Corte Costituzionale risponde affermando che l'autorizzazione del Giudice tutelare è solo finalizzata ad integrare la volontà della minorenne (dati i vincoli gravanti sulla sua capacità di agire), soprattutto in presenza dei presupposti clinici e legislativi previsti dalla normativa, in poche parole si potrebbe affermare che il ruolo del Giudice si esaurisce in una sorta di controllo della \"regolarità\" della procedura. Quindi, l'autorizzazione del Giudice Tutelare non ha la funzione di decidere al posto della donna (cioè non sostituisce la volontà della donna) e non ha la funzione di decidere congiuntamente con la donna (creando una sorta di decisione condivisa) soprattutto quando sussistono i requistiti medici e legislativi previsti dalla legge n. 194 art. 4 che consentono l'aborto (infatti, la prosecuzione della gravidanza può essere impedita quando il parto o la maternità comporta un serio pericolo per la sua salute fisica o psichica della donna o in caso di previsioni di anomalie o malformazioni del concepito). CORTE COSTITUZIONALE ORDINANZA del 19 luglio 2012 n. 196 nel giudizio di legittimità costituzionale dell’articolo 4 della legge 22 maggio 1978, n. 194 (Norme per la tutela sociale della maternità e sull’interruzione volontaria della gravidanza), promosso dal Giudice tutelare del Tribunale ordinario di Spoleto nel procedimento relativo a F.N., con ordinanza del 3 gennaio 2012, iscritta al n. 60 del registro ordinanze 2012 e pubblicata nella Gazzetta Ufficiale della Repubblica n. 16, prima serie speciale, dell’anno 2012. Ritenuto che – nel corso di un procedimento ex articolo 12 della legge 22 maggio 1978, n. 194 (Norme per la tutela sociale della maternità e sull’interruzione volontaria della gravidanza), attivato a seguito della richiesta, del locale Consultorio familiare, di autorizzare una minorenne a decidere l’interruzione volontaria della gravidanza senza informarne i genitori – l’adito Giudice tutelare del Tribunale ordinario di Spoleto ha sollevato, con ordinanza emessa il 3 gennaio 2012, questione di legittimità costituzionale dell’articolo 4 della predetta legge n. 194, nella parte in cui prevede la facoltà della donna, in presenza delle condizioni ivi stabilite, di procedere volontariamente alla interruzione volontaria della gravidanza entro i primi novanta giorni dal concepimento, per contrasto con gli articoli 2, 32, primo comma, 11 e 117, primo comma della Costituzione;\n",

Ah, se non amate il genere, tenetevi alla larga dai trailer! “Halloween – The Beginning” – di Rob Zombie (2007) Il film è un mix tra prequel e remake, ma il vero scopo principale di Zombie è stato quello di rendere Michael Myers un personaggio del mondo horror nuovamente temibile e assetato di sangue. Il regista ha cercato di prendere gli elementi migliori degli otto capitoli e unirli creando un film altamente godibile e terrificante. Vedremo un Myers 12 enne con una madre spogliarellista e padre alcolizzato, massacrare tutta la famiglia durante la notte di Halloween, finendo in manicomio. Dopo diciassette anni riesce a scappare e si lancia alla ricerca della sorellina minore, per proteggerla, forse, uccidendo altre famiglie e giovani studentesse, le sue prede preferite. “Shutter” – di Banjong Pisanthanakun (2004) E’ uno dei film horror più disturbanti in assoluto. La storia è incentrata su Tun e Jane, due giovani che, di ritorno in macchina da un matrimonio, investono una ragazza che muore sul colpo. Presi dal panico i due scappano, senza prestarle soccorso. Dopo un po’ di tempo, tutto sembra tornato alla vita normale ma, un improvvisamente, nelle fotografie di Tun, che di mestiere fa appunto il fotografo, iniziano ad apparire delle strane ombre, una luce anomala, la sagoma di una ragazza. E’ l’inizio di un incubo angosciante con un finale tremendamente a sorpresa. “Il Messaggero – The Haunting in Connecticut” – di Peter Cornwell (2009) Il film si basa su reali eventi paranormali avvenuti a Southington, nel Connecticut, vissuti tra gli anni Settanta e Ottanta dalla famiglia Snedeker. La mamma è Sara, devastata da una vita che non le ha di certo risparmiato dolori. Il marito ha dei problemi con l'alcol e il figlio maschio, Matt, è affetto da un cancro per il quale necessita di cure speciali. La famiglia decide, quindi, di affittare una casa nella zona vicina all'ospedale in cui Matt viene sottoposto alle terapie. Proprio il ragazzo inizierà a percepire strane presenze e per capire come combattrle, ricorrerà all’aiuto d un misterioso amico di terapie, esperto in fenomeni paranormali.

      "Un team di ricerca internazionale coordinato dal Wyss Center for Bio and Neuroengineering di Ginevra (Svizzera) ha messo a punto una tecnologia in grado di ‘leggere la mente' attraverso l'analisi dei livelli di ossigeno presenti nel sangue del cervello, permettendo la comunicazione anche ai malati con sindrome locked-in, una condizione clinica nella quale si è coscienti ma totalmente paralizzati. Il dispositivo utilizzato, seppur estremamente acerbo dal punto di vista delle opzioni offerte, ha dato modo a quattro malati di SLA di tornare a ‘parlare' con i propri famigliari dopo anni di assoluto silenzio in un lettino d'ospedale. Si tratta di un traguardo straordinario che getta le basi per future conquiste in questo delicatissimo campo medico. La tecnologia, chiamata “functional near-infrared spectroscopy”, ha un'accuratezza del 70 percento e al momento riesce a decifrare solo i sì e i no quando vengono sottoposte le domande al malato. Può sembrare molto poco, inoltre è un modo di comunicare del tutto univoco, tuttavia per persone che vivono completamente immobilizzate in un letto d'ospedale, poter esprimere sentimenti e condizioni è un passo avanti enorme. Lo è anche per i famigliari che vivono questo dramma. Non è un caso che alla domanda “sei felice” tutti i sottoposti al test abbiano risposto affermativamente. Del resto esistono diversi macchinari in grado di ‘leggere il pensiero', come peculiari ECG (elettroencefalografie) che analizzano l'attività elettrica dei muscoli, ma essi non sono efficaci per i pazienti con la sindrome locked-in. La sindrome locked-in è una condizione apparentemente simile allo stato vegetativo, tuttavia è molto differente dal punto di vista clinico. In questo stato, conosciuto anche col nome di sindrome chiavistello, pseudocoma o disconnessione cerebromedullospinale, il paziente è infatti perfettamente cosciente e con gli occhi aperti, ma non può muovere nemmeno un muscolo. È una condizione complessa che spesso accompagna le fasi finali nei malati di SLA e altre patologie degenerative, ma può emergere anche in seguito a gravi ictus. Ricerche come quella coordinata dagli studiosi svizzeri, i cui dettagli sono stati pubblicati su PloS Biology, possono aiutare a renderle meno dolorose.\n",

      "Laura Pausini è mamma della piccola Paola che il giorno 8 maggio compirà 3 mesi: per il momento la cantante ha messo da parte i concerti e si dedica a pieno tempo alla sua attività di madre. I fan non disperino: sarà tra le protagoniste di uno speciale concerto con Beyoncé a Londra, il “The Sound of Change Life” che si terrà il prossimo 1° giugno al Twickenham Stadium della capitale inglese. Nel frattempo, i paparazzi seguono la Pausini durante un'uscita mattutina insieme a Paola: le due si sono godute i primi giorni di sole al parco a Milano e sono rientrate in auto dopo un po'. Laura si è resa conto dei fotografi a cui ha accennato anche un sorriso: del resto è un periodo d'oro e ha scelto di condividere la sua felicità con i fan e sostenitori alla luce del giorno.\n",

      "L'evento di presentazione durante il quale Apple ha presentato i suoi ultimi iPhone si è concluso lasciando parecchi spettatori convinti a mettere le mani su uno dei nuovi dispositivi. Se però i più esperti sono riusciti a capire fin da subito quale dei gadget proposti sia quello che fa al caso loro, non vale necessariamente lo stesso per il grande pubblico, che nei negozi dovrà decidere se scegliere un iPhone 13 o un iPhone 13 Mini o se mettere le mani su uno di modelli professionali, iPhone 13 Pro o iPhone 13 Pro Max. Ecco dunque le principali differenze tra le due sotto-categorie di telefoni lanciate ieri. La prima differenza consiste nella scocca. Mentre il telaio dei modelli standard e Mini è realizzato in alluminio, i due modelli Pro hanno un rivestimento in acciaio chirurgico inossidabile, con una finitura resistente ad abrasione e corrosione e un vetro opaco. Tutti i modelli hanno uno schermo protetto dallo stesso vetro, battezzato Ceramic Shield, mentre i colori della scocca sono diversi. Per i modelli dedicati al grande pubblico sono disponibili Rosa, Blu, Mezzanotte, Galassia e Rosso; per i modelli Pro le tonalità sono Azzurro Sierra, Argento, Oro e Grafite. Per chi apprezza telefoni particolarmente compatti oppure dalle dimensioni generose, la scelta tra le due tipologie di modelli sarà fondamentale. Come avvenuto per la scorsa generazione di iPhone, le varianti standard includono un modello Mini con uno schermo da soli 5,4 pollici di diagonale che misura 132 x 64 x 7,65 millimetri. Al contrario, il telefono più grande del quartetto è il modello Pro Max, con uno schermo da 6,7 pollici e 160,8 x 78,1 x 7,7 millimetri di dimensioni. Nel mezzo stanno i rimanenti due telefoni, iPhone 13 e iPhone 13 Pro, con schermi da 6,1 pollici e il medesimo ingombro da 146,7 x 71,5 x 7,7 millimetri. Per la prima volta nella storia di iPhone, Apple ha deciso di proporre due configurazioni diverse del suo processore da destinare ai modelli di una medesima generazione. Su iPhone 13 e iPhone 13 Mini troverà comunque posto il veloce e sofisticato chip Apple A15 Bionic, basato su processo produttivo a 5 nanometri. Su iPhone 13 Pro e iPhone 13 Pro Max il sistema potrà però disporre di 5 unità dedicate all'elaborazione grafica: questi nuclei aggiuntivi serviranno a gestire la mole di lavoro aggiuntiva richiesta dalle riprese professionali e dalle altre funzioni esclusive dei modelli Pro; i gadget che non ne disporranno insomma non ne sentiranno la mancanza. Il sistema fotografico cambia sensibilmente tra i modelli standard e i modelli Pro. I primi disporranno di due fotocamere — una grandangolare e una ultra-grandangolare. Gli iPhone 13 dedicati ai professionisti monteranno invece tre fotocamere con sensori più grandi e lenti ad apertura minore; l'obbiettivo; la fotocamera aggiuntiva è uno zoom 3X, mentre quella ultra-grandangolare si potrà utilizzare anche per gli scatti in modalità macro, avvicinandosi fino a 2 centimetri dall'oggetto da riprendere. Dal punto di vista della produzione video, i gadget professionali offriranno supporto al formato di codifica video ProRes che su iPhone 13 e 13 Mini invece non sarà a disposizione.\n",

      "Dieci canzoni, alcuni dei più grandi successi di Lucio Dalla, per ripercorrere il genio, l'arte e presto anche il mito, dell'artista scomparso oggi per un improvviso attacco di cuore. Era in Svizzera per il tour che gli aveva regalato già immense soddisfazioni e diversi sold-out in tutta Europa, reduce dal festival di Sanremo 2012, al aveva partecipato con la canzone Nanì, scritta a quattro mani con il giovanissimo Pierdavide Carone. Di seguito 10 dei suoi successi più belli, per ricordarlo con le note che gli hanno permesso di rimanere per sempre nella storia della musica italiana come uno dei cantautori più amati. Piazza Grande – 1972. Da Napoli a Bologna, la sua Bologna. Comunemente ricordata come A modo mio, come recita il ritornello, la canzone è stata scritta da Ron, e parla della sua città descritta dagli occhi di un senza tetto. Lenzuola bianche per coprirci non ne ho sotto le stelle in Piazza Grande, e se la vita non ha sogni io li ho e te li do. I sogni e le speranze di chi non ha niente. Caruso – 1986. Una canzone che ha dato un impeto di napoletanità all’artista bolognese, che a modo suo un po’ partenopeo ci si sentiva. Te voglio bene assai ma tanto tanto bene sai, recita l’inciso di Caruso, la canzone che ha reso omaggio a Napoli, descrivendo con delle parole che sembravano dipingere il Golfo di Sorrento. 4 Marzo 1943 – 1971. La canzone che ha il titolo della data di nascita di Dalla, è solo parzialmente autobiografica. Nel ’71 fu inizialmente censurata a Sanremo, perché il tema tabù della ragazza madre fu giudicato scandaloso e irriverente, anche il titolo originale fu cambiato, Gesù Bambino, inadeguato all’epoca. Attenti al lupo – 1990. Una delle canzoni più divertenti e simpatiche di Lucio Dalla: C’è una casetta piccola così.. chiunque sarebbe in grado di continuare queste strofe, impresse nella memoria della gente. Fa così familiare, come se ogni padre l’avesse trasmessa al figlio negli ultimi vent’anni.\n",

      "Una Milano rivisitata attraverso il surrealismo e corpi levitanti, ecco il lavoro di Eribluff, pseudonimo dietro al quale si muove la figura artistica di Erika Zolli. “L'idea che sta alla base dell'intero lavoro è quella di voler mostrare una quotidianità, che è appunto la quotidianità della città in cui vivo, Milano, in un contesto poetico e affascinante. Filo conduttore di questi scatti è la Levitazione, intesa come leggerezza, come capacità di guardare il mondo con occhi che non conoscono la gravità e le sue leggi. Una levitazione che si contrappone ai limiti del pessimismo post-moderno, ricordandoci il valore e la profondità dell'essere umano. Ecco perché, attraverso il simbolismo, intendo esplorare il mondo invisibile che risiede nel cuore di una città che pulsa di vita”. La Piazza Mercanti, il Castello Sforzesco, il Parco di Porta Venezia, il Teatro Dal Verme, la Galleria D'Arte Moderna e la Basilica di Sant'Ambrogio, sono i soggetti dell'ultimo progetto fotografico di Eribluff, “Levitation Project”, in cui tali luoghi caratteristici di Milano vengono immortalati in una realtà onirica di un mondo nuovo per l'osservatore ma assolutamente reale, dove i soggetti fluttuano in bolle di sapone. Questa giovane fotografa di Fine-art è sempre stata attratta dalle potenzialità che ha la fotografia di condurre l’osservatore in un mondo di surreale poesia. Nuovi mondi, nuove realtà, nelle sue foto, esplorano l’invisibile dimensione onirica che risiede nella mente umana. Per conoscere altri lavori dell'artista visitate la sua pagina Facebook.\n",

      "Secondo il leader della Lega, Matteo Salvini, le varianti del Covid “nascono come reazione al vaccino”. Un’affermazione che contraddice tutti gli studi scientifici in materia e che anche l’Istituto superiore di sanità, il ministero della Salute e l’Oms smentiscono spiegando cosa siano le varianti e come nascono. Salvini ha parlato delle varianti in riferimento al green pass e all’eventuale obbligo vaccinale, sostenendo che la migliore garanzia per ridurre la circolazione del virus sia sottoporre le persone a quanti più tamponi possibile, uno strumento che lui ritiene più efficace del vaccino. E proprio per questo tira in ballo le varianti, con l’obiettivo di spiegare che il vaccino non è uno strumento insostituibile avendo – nel suo ragionamento – anche controindicazioni di questo tipo, riguardanti la diffusione del virus. Salvini viene intervistato durante la trasmissione L’Aria che tira, su La7, e critica il green pass per tutti i lavoratori, misura secondo lui non realizzabile. La soluzione, comunque, è garantire i tamponi, a suo avviso, in quanto sono “il metodo più sicuro per individuare il positivo e il negativo”. “Io sono vaccinato con la seconda dose ma posso prenderlo e posso trasmetterlo – è il ragionamento che porta avanti Salvini – se faccio un tampone in questo momento sicuramente sono negativo, quindi lo strumento imbattibile e indiscutibile è il tampone”. Anche se va precisato che non tutti i tamponi, soprattutto quelli rapidi, hanno la stessa affidabilità, che possono dare falsi negativi. E comunque la loro validità è sostanzialmente legata al momento effettivo in cui viene eseguito il prelievo. Secondo Salvini non è vero che il virus continua a circolare a causa dei non vaccinati e aggiunge: “Facciamo informazione corretta: le varianti nascono come reazione al vaccino, è il mestiere del vaccino. Se io provo ad ammazzare il virus, lui cerca di sopravvivere variando, reagendo al vaccino, è per questo che in Israele, che è il Paese più vaccinato al mondo, ci sono” i contagi in aumento. Vediamo perché le affermazioni di Salvini sono sbagliate. Per capire cosa sono le varianti e come nascono ci affidiamo a fonti istituzionali e autorità internazionali in materia di sanità. Per esempio sul sito dell’Istituto superiore di sanità viene spiegato che i virus evolvono e non fanno eccezione i coronavirus come il Sars-Cov-2. Si sottolinea come le mutazioni del Covid-19 siano state scoperte in più parti del mondo “già fin dall’inizio della pandemia”. Il ministero della Salute spiega che quando il virus si replica “a volte cambia leggermente”, dando vita alle mutazioni: “Un virus con una o più nuove mutazioni viene indicato come una variante”. La maggior parte delle mutazioni non cambia completamente il virus, mentre altre sono più incisive. E possono portare a diverse conseguenze: una maggiore trasmissibilità, forme più severe di malattia o anche aggirare o ridurre gli effetti della vaccinazione. Tuttavia è l’Oms a spiegare con parole più chiare perché ciò che dice Salvini è completamente falso, anzi è vero il suo esatto contrario: “Più il virus circola, più può cambiare”. Cambiamenti che in alcuni casi possono dare vita alle varianti. Vale a dire che il vaccino, pur avendo come effetto principale la riduzione dei casi gravi, riducendo il numero di contagi offrendo una seppur non totale immunità è uno strumento efficace per contrastare la diffusione di nuove varianti. L’Oms spiega ancora come nascono le varianti: “Quanto più un virus circola ampiamente tra la popolazione e causa molte infezioni, più aumenta la probabilità che il virus subisca mutazioni. Più opportunità il virus ha di circolare, più si replica e più può venire modificato”. Ma l’Oms fa di più, smentendo in pieno Salvini: “Aumentare la produzione dei vaccini e distribuirli il più velocemente possibile sarà anche un sistema per proteggere le persone prima che possano essere esposte al virus e al rischio di nuove varanti. La priorità dovrebbe essere quella di immunizzare i gruppi più a rischio ovunque a livello globale per massimizzare la protezione contro le nuove varianti e ridurre al minimo il rischio di trasmissione”. Quindi più ci si vaccina, meno nascono nuove varianti, dice l’Oms. Inoltre, l'organizzazione sottolinea l’importanza di garantire un equo accesso al vaccino in tutto il mondo: “Più persone vengono vaccinate, più ci aspettiamo che la circolazione diminuisca, il che porterà ad avere meno mutazioni”, conclude con chiarezza.\n",

La soluzione, comunque, è garantire i tamponi, a suo avviso, in quanto sono “il metodo più sicuro per individuare il positivo e il negativo”. “Io sono vaccinato con la seconda dose ma posso prenderlo e posso trasmetterlo – è il ragionamento che porta avanti Salvini – se faccio un tampone in questo momento sicuramente sono negativo, quindi lo strumento imbattibile e indiscutibile è il tampone”. Anche se va precisato che non tutti i tamponi, soprattutto quelli rapidi, hanno la stessa affidabilità, che possono dare falsi negativi. E comunque la loro validità è sostanzialmente legata al momento effettivo in cui viene eseguito il prelievo. Secondo Salvini non è vero che il virus continua a circolare a causa dei non vaccinati e aggiunge: “Facciamo informazione corretta: le varianti nascono come reazione al vaccino, è il mestiere del vaccino. Se io provo ad ammazzare il virus, lui cerca di sopravvivere variando, reagendo al vaccino, è per questo che in Israele, che è il Paese più vaccinato al mondo, ci sono” i contagi in aumento. Vediamo perché le affermazioni di Salvini sono sbagliate. Per capire cosa sono le varianti e come nascono ci affidiamo a fonti istituzionali e autorità internazionali in materia di sanità. Per esempio sul sito dell’Istituto superiore di sanità viene spiegato che i virus evolvono e non fanno eccezione i coronavirus come il Sars-Cov-2. Si sottolinea come le mutazioni del Covid-19 siano state scoperte in più parti del mondo “già fin dall’inizio della pandemia”. Il ministero della Salute spiega che quando il virus si replica “a volte cambia leggermente”, dando vita alle mutazioni: “Un virus con una o più nuove mutazioni viene indicato come una variante”. La maggior parte delle mutazioni non cambia completamente il virus, mentre altre sono più incisive. E possono portare a diverse conseguenze: una maggiore trasmissibilità, forme più severe di malattia o anche aggirare o ridurre gli effetti della vaccinazione. Tuttavia è l’Oms a spiegare con parole più chiare perché ciò che dice Salvini è completamente falso, anzi è vero il suo esatto contrario: “Più il virus circola, più può cambiare”. Cambiamenti che in alcuni casi possono dare vita alle varianti. Vale a dire che il vaccino, pur avendo come effetto principale la riduzione dei casi gravi, riducendo il numero di contagi offrendo una seppur non totale immunità è uno strumento efficace per contrastare la diffusione di nuove varianti. L’Oms spiega ancora come nascono le varianti: “Quanto più un virus circola ampiamente tra la popolazione e causa molte infezioni, più aumenta la probabilità che il virus subisca mut\n"

      "L’ingresso di Carla Cruz nella Casa del Grande Fratello Vip 2017 è avvenuto un po’ in sordina. La bellissima mora entrata insieme a Ivana Mrazova, valletta di Gianni Morandi a Sanremo 2012, ha colto tutti di sorpresa. Il pubblico non ha riconosciuto la giovane, anche perché prima di oggi non aveva mai partecipato direttamente a una trasmissione televisiva. Eppure Carla è un volto noto che qualcuno potrebbe avere riconosciuto. Deve la sua popolarità al fidanzato noto in Italia. Si tratta di Simone Rugiati, chef tv particolarmente famoso nonché conduttore di Tu si que vales insieme a Belén Rodriguez. Di Carla non si sa molto, tranne che si tratta di una modella ecuadoregna trapiantata in Italia da diversi anni. Non ha all’attivo partecipazioni a trasmissioni tv che potessero regalarle la popolarità. In questo senso, il Gf Vip è stato il suo battesimo del fuoco. È giovanissima – ha solo 24 anni – ma ha già le idee chiare. Si è trasferita in Italia 9 anni fa e da circa 3 anni vive da sola a Milano. Ama viaggiare, adora i cani ed è la protagonista di numerose campagne pubblicitarie che ne esaltano i tratti orientaleggianti e la sensualità. La storia d’amore con Simone Rugiati divenne di dominio pubblico nel gennaio di quest’anno. Fu proprio lo chef, intervistato da Silvia Toffanin durante una puntata di Verissimo, a svelare di essere fidanzato con Carla da due anni. Rugiati rivelò di averla tenuta nascosta fino a questo momento solo allo scopo di proteggerla: Carla è ecuadoregna, ho cercato di tenerla protetta fino a oggi, non volevo che questo mondo la stressasse. Lei l’ha presa male all’inizio, credeva che non volessi farmi vedere con lei. Stiamo insieme da 2 anni e 4 mesi, per me è un record. Conviviamo. Purtroppo, le ultime foto di coppia che mostrano i due insieme risalgono alla fine dello scorso anno, indizio che potrebbe indicare ci sia stata una rottura tra i due. Ad avvalorare la tesi della storia finita è il fatto che Carla ha trascorso queste vacanze estive a Ibiza con le amiche, mentre Rugiati è rimasto in Italia per lavoro.\n",

Un clima disteso e “positivo”, così come lo definiscono fonti della Lega. Che potrebbe portare un po’ di sereno nella maggioranza di governo. Dopo l’appello del presidente del Consiglio, Giuseppe Conte, quindi, i leader dei due partiti di maggioranza si sono riavvicinati, accogliendo l’invito espresso dall’inquilino di Palazzo Chigi. E lo stesso Conte apprezza questo riavvicinamento, giudicando positivamente il fatto che dopo la conferenza stampa di ieri “i leader delle due forze di maggioranza siano tornati a parlarsi”. Fonti di Palazzo Chigi fanno sapere che “il ritorno al dialogo è una buona premessa – proprio come auspicato ieri nel discorso di Conte – per procedere nella giusta direzione”. Fonti di entrambi i partiti parlano non solo di un confronto positivo e costruttivo, ma anche di buone speranze “sulla sorte del governo”. Come riporta l’Agi, per molti questa telefonata rappresenta un “primo passo” dopo settimane di scontro continuo, iniziato in campagna elettorale e proseguito anche dopo il voto del 26 maggio delle elezioni europee e comunali. Ora i due leader sembrano voler ricostruire il rapporto che si era incrinato negli ultimi mesi. Subito dopo la telefonata, a conferma di quanto sostenuto da fonti di entrambi i partiti, è anche arrivato l’accordo tra Lega e M5s sul decreto Sblocca cantieri, che ieri era stato causa di un nuovo scontro tra i due alleati ad appena un’ora di distanza dalle prime schiarite seguite all’appello di Conte. Fonti di governo fanno sapere che l’intesa è stata trovata, proprio come auspicato in giornata soprattutto dal leader leghista, Matteo Salvini, che si diceva certo di poter trovare un accordo. Dopo la telefonata è previsto, probabilmente per i prossimi giorni, un incontro tra i due vicepresidenti del Consiglio per proseguire nell’azione di governo e dare vita a quella “leale collaborazione” che il presidente del Consiglio ha chiesto durante la sua conferenza stampa di ieri a Palazzo Chigi.\n",

      "Marco Mengoni come Miley Cyrus e Taylor Swift. Il cantante di Ronciglione, infatti, ha disattivato tutti i suoi canali social (Facebook, Twitter e Instagram), oscurando così tutto il suo passato social. I motivi, ovviamente, non sono noti anche se solitamente questo tipo di operazione è preludio di novità discografiche, come avvenne, ad esempio proprio prima della Swift e del suo ultimo album \"Reputation\" il cui primo singolo, tra l'altro, parlava proprio di rete e odio online.

      "Marco Mengoni come Miley Cyrus e Taylor Swift. Il cantante di Ronciglione, infatti, ha disattivato tutti i suoi canali social (Facebook, Twitter e Instagram), oscurando così tutto il suo passato social. I motivi, ovviamente, non sono noti anche se solitamente questo tipo di operazione è preludio di novità discografiche, come avvenne, ad esempio proprio prima della Swift e del suo ultimo album \"Reputation\" il cui primo singolo, tra l'altro, parlava proprio di rete e odio online.

      "Potrebbe essere arrivata al capolinea la storia d’amore tra Aurora Ramazzotti ed Edoardo Gori. La figlia di Eros, sempre più star dei social network, sta trascorrendo le sue vacanze estive in Spagna insieme alle amiche e la stessa cosa accade al nipote di Giorgio Gori. Il fatto è che lo stanno facendo separatamente e in due località diverse. Edoardo è partito alla volta di Valencia in compagnia degli amici e con loro si diverte a scattare numerosi selfie che poi posta sul suo profilo Instagram. Aurora, invece, si è regalata qualche giorno a Formentera e anche lei è insieme alle amiche. Del fidanzato non c’è traccia. A preoccupare di più i numerosi followers che seguono da sempre la loro storia d’amore è una frase postata dalla meravigliosa figlia di Michelle Hunziker su Instagram. La 18enne Aurora, che a settembre si trasferirà a Londra, ha condiviso sui social una frase tratta dal libro “L'ombra del vento” di Carlos Ruiz Zafòn, e che recita: Qualcuno ha detto che nel momento in cui ti soffermi a pensare se ami o meno una persona hai già la risposta.\n",

Si potrebbe sostenere che per la prima volta la locuzione “semplificata” rispecchia al realtà dei fatti. Caratteristiche dei soci. È stato previsto che persone minori di anni 35 possono (con un euro di capitale) costituire una società a responsabilità limitata, senza dover richiedere l’intervento di un notaio (si tratta di un notevole cambio di direzione, se solo si nota che altre novità come il vincolo di destinazione ex art. 2645 ter c.c. e il patto di famiglia ex art. 768 ter c.c. richiedono, non la semplice forma sciritta, ma l'atto pubblico). Costituzione. La società semplificata a responsabilità limitata può essere costituita con contratto o atto unilaterale, (quindi il socio può essere unico o vi può essere una pluralità di soci), ma soci possono essere solo persone fisiche (non giuridiche) e tali persone fisiche non devono aver compiuto i trentacinque anni di età alla data della costituzione. Il limite di età è una delle caratteristiche della norma e della nuova Srl semplificata. Forma dell'atto costitutivo. L’atto costitutivo deve essere redatto per scrittura privata, quindi, sicuramente non è richiesto l’atto pubblico, ma non è, neppure, richiesta (espressamente) la scrittura privata autenticata, questo dovrebbe far pensare che è stato completamente escluso (almeno in questa fase) dal procedimento di stipula dell'atto costitutivo il notaio (con il relativo costo), del resto la stessa legge prevede che l'ufficiale del registro deve accertare la sussistenza dei requisiti richiesti e procedere all'iscrizione entro il termine perentorio di quindici giorni1.
